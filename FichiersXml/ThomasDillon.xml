'''Thomas Lee Dillon''' (July 9, 1950&lt;ref name="offender"&gt;[http://www.drc.state.oh.us/OffenderSearch/Details.aspx?id=A277618&amp;pg=x Dillon profile at the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weird"&gt;Willis, James A., Andrew Henderson and Loren Coleman. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BYHK2lN5KzoC&amp;pg=PA108 ''Weird Ohio: Your Travel Guide to Ohio's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets'', "Ohio's Unsportsmanlike Sniper", pp. 108-110]. Sterling Publishing Co., Ltd. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; – October 21, 2011) was an American [[serial killer]] who shot and killed five men in southeastern [[Ohio]], beginning April 1, 1989 and continuing until April 1992.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=David|title=A Sniper's Mind|work=CBSNEWS.com|publisher=CBS News|date=February 11, 2009|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/23/60II/main526716.shtml|accessdate=August 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and crimes==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2017}}
Dillon was born in [[Canton, Ohio]] and was a resident of nearby [[Magnolia, Ohio|Magnolia]]. He had a wife and son and was employed for twelve years as a [[draftsman]] at the [[Canton, Ohio|Canton Ohio]] Waterworks. 

Between the period of April 1, 1989 to April 5, 1992, Dillon shot and killed five people in Ohio. His fourth victim, Claude Hawkins, was shot on [[Federal lands|federal property]] and was the reason the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] stepped in to join the investigation along with officers from the other three counties and the [[Ohio Department of Natural Resources]]. It was after this that the death of Kevin Loring was changed from an accident to a homicide.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Ten days after the [[task force]] meeting, Dillon would shoot his fifth victim, Gary Bradley, in [[Noble County, Ohio]]. Dillon was placed under surveillance in 1992 when a friend reported him after hearing the task force's initial press release concerning the murders. Larry Oller of [[Barnhill, Ohio]] was later shot at by Dillon while out hunting in [[Tuscarawas County, Ohio|Tuscarawas County]], but he escaped uninjured. 

== Arrest ==
Dillon was arrested on a weapons charge on November 27, 1992, and he was placed under probation for owning a [[suppressor]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

After the death penalty was removed as an option for punishment, Dillon admitted to the killings. On July 12, 1993 at the [[Noble County Courthouse (Ohio)|Noble County Courthouse]], Dillon pleaded guilty to the five murders. Dillon was incarcerated at the [[Southern Ohio Correctional Facility]] for five [[consecutive sentence]]s of thirty years to life for [[aggravated murder]].&lt;ref name="offender"/&gt;

After an attempt by Dillon's wife to sell Dillon's story to Hollywood, Jean Paxton, Jamie Paxton's mother, and Ohio State Senator [[Bob Ney]], passed the Paxton Bill, which barred killers or their relatives from profiting from their crimes.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Victims==
Dillon's shooting victims were:&lt;ref name="Times Reporter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrison|first=Lee|title=Hunter murderer Thomas Lee Dillon dies at 61|work=TimesReporter.com|publisher=The Times Reporter|date=October 23, 2011|url=http://www.timesreporter.com/communities/coshocton/x464391936/Hunter-murderer-Thomas-Lee-Dillon-dies-at-61|accessdate=August 30, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424232944/http://www.timesreporter.com/communities/coshocton/x464391936/Hunter-murderer-Thomas-Lee-Dillon-dies-at-61|archivedate=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dillon was also investigated in connection with the unsolved shooting death of John Joseph Harvat on November 28, 1984, at a hunting camp in [[Wetmore Township, McKean County, Pennsylvania]]. In 1993, officials in Coshocton County notified the Pennsylvania State Police that Dillon had been named a suspect in several similar shootings in Ohio, but Dillon refused to discuss Harvat's case with police.&lt;ref name="crimestoppers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Release #2282, Suspicious Death of John Joseph Harvat – Wetmore Township, McKean County, PA|publisher=Pennsylvania Crime Stoppers|date=July 6, 2018|url=https://www.crimewatchpa.com/crimestoppers/316/cases/media-release-2282-suspicious-death-john-joseph-harvat-%E2%80%93-wetmore-township-mckean-county-pa|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

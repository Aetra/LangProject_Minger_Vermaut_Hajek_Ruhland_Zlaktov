'''Daniel Lee Siebert''' (June 17, 1954 â€“ April 22, 2008) was an American [[serial killer]]  on [[Alabama]]'s [[death row]]. He was convicted of three murders and confessed to at least five. During questioning he indicated that he was responsible for at least 12 deaths. Siebert died on April 22, 2008 in [[Holman Correctional Facility|Holman Prison]] near [[Atmore, Alabama|Atmore]] of complications from cancer.&lt;ref name="AP1"&gt;Hunter, Desiree. "[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-04-23-1743623889_x.htm Alabama death row inmate who challenged protocol dies]." ''[[Associated Press]]'' at ''[[USA Today]]''. April 23, 2008. Retrieved on March 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Killings==
Siebert's first known killing took place in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was convicted of manslaughter.&lt;ref name="newton"&gt;{{cite book| last = Newton| first = Michael| title = Hunting Humans: An Encyclopedia of Modern Serial Killers| isbn =}} Quoted in {{cite web| title = Daniel Lee Siebert| work = Murderpedia| url = http://www.murderpedia.org/male.S/s/siebert-daniel.htm| accessdate = 10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siebert was charged with the 1985 murders of two women in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref name="malnic1987"&gt;{{cite web| last = Malnic| first = Eric|author2=Jack Jones| title = Murderer in Alabama Confesses 2 L.A.

In 1986, he murdered a student at the [[Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind]] in [[Talladega, Alabama|Talladega]] and her two children. Sherri Weathers had missed classes for over a week, and the school had worried that she had not contacted them with an explanation. A search of her apartment found her dead body, along with those of her two children.&lt;ref name="newton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="malnic1987" /&gt;

Investigation also revealed another student who was missing from the institute. Linda Jarman was found dead in her apartment, also murdered. He was also charged with the murder of Linda Odum, a waitress who he had been dating. She was reported missing in February and her remains discovered in March. Fingerprints linked Siebert to her stolen car. Police believed Siebert was also involved in the death of Sheryl Evans of Calhoun County, whose body was found around the same time.&lt;ref name="newton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="malnic1987" /&gt; Siebert was charged with the death of Beatrice McDougall in Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1986.&lt;ref name="malnic1987" /&gt; In custody, Siebert said he had committed 12 or more murders.&lt;ref name="newton" /&gt;

==Discovery==
An art teacher using the name "Daniel Spence" was questioned in connection with the crime after police were notified that he had an interest in Sherri Weathers. A check of Spence's [[fingerprint]]s revealed that he was in fact Daniel Siebert, who had a previous conviction of [[manslaughter]] in 1979 and was wanted on [[assault]] charges in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], California.&lt;ref name="newton" /&gt;

Siebert spent the next six months on the run. He was apprehended in [[Hurricane Mills, Tennessee]], after placing a phone call to a friend who reported him to the police. His next call was traced to a phone booth near a restaurant where he was working and he was arrested the following day when he showed up for work.&lt;ref name="malnic1987" /&gt;

==Imprisonment==

Siebert was convicted in the capital cases involving Jarman, and the case of Weathers and her children. Siebert's execution date was set for October 25, 2007 for the murders of Weathers and her children. Assistant Attorney General Clay Crenshaw said Siebert had exhausted all of his appeals for the killing of Weathers and her children.  Siebert had been undergoing treatment for [[pancreatic cancer]].  Siebert's execution was delayed hours before it was to occur.

He had the Alabama Institutional Serial #00Z475.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doc.state.al.us/deathrow.asp |title="Inmates on Deathrow." |accessdate=2007-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209184118/http://www.doc.state.al.us/deathrow.asp |archivedate=February 9, 2007 }} [[Alabama Department of Corrections]].

'''Donato "Walter" Bilancia''', (born July 10, 1951) is an [[Italians|Italian]] [[serial killer]] who murdered seventeen people – nine women and eight men – on the [[Italian Riviera]] in the period from October 1997 to May 1998.&lt;ref name=BP/&gt;

Bilancia's inconsistent [[modus operandi]] made him difficult to identify and capture. There were no obvious links between the majority of his murders. He chose most of his victims at random, across a vast area of [[Northern Italy]] and becoming synonym for fear among the Italian Riviera population, being nicknamed ''Mostro della Liguria'' ("The Liguria Monster") and ''L'assassino dei treni'' ("Killer on the trains").

Initially attributed with only nine homicides by the [[Italian police]], Bilancia later confessed to having killed eight other people. With a sentence to 13 terms of [[life imprisonment]], and no possibility of release, Bilancia has been defined by some Italian newspapers as "the most horrifying serial killer in the history of Italy".&lt;ref name=DB1&gt;{{cite web|language=Italian|title=Donato Bilancia è uscito dal carcere.

==Biography==
===Background and early crimes===
[[File:Mercedes Benz 190 black vr.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Mercedes-Benz W201]]-190 used by Bilancia. It was an important point in the reconstruction of the facts that led to his identification.]]
Bilancia was born in [[Potenza]], [[Basilicata]], in 1951. When he was about five years old, his family moved to northern Italy, first to [[Piedmont]] and then to [[Genoa]] in the [[Liguria]] region.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt;  He was a chronic [[enuresis|bedwetter]] until age 10 or 12,&lt;ref name=occhirossi&gt;[http://www.occhirossi.it/biografie/DonatoBilancia.htm Donato Bilancia], Occhirossi {{in lang|it}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother shamed him by placing his wet mattress on the balcony where it could be seen by the neighbors.  When undressing him for bed, his aunt would shame him by pulling down his underwear in front of his cousins to show his underdeveloped penis.&lt;ref name=latelanera&gt;[http://www.latelanera.com/serialkiller/serialkillerdossier.asp?id=DonatoBilancia&amp;pg=1 Dossier Donato Bilancia], latelanera.com {{in lang|it}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At age 14, he decided to start calling himself Walter.  He dropped out of high school and worked at jobs such as mechanic, bartender, baker and delivery boy.&lt;ref name=occhirossi/&gt;

While still underage, he was arrested and released for stealing a [[motor scooter]] and for stealing a truck loaded with Christmas sweets.  In 1974 he was stopped and jailed for having an illegal gun.  At some point he was [[Involuntary commitment|committed]] to the [[psychiatric]] division of the Genoa General Hospital, but escaped.  After he was apprehended, he spent 18 months in prison for robbery.  He served several prison terms in Italy and France for robbery and armed robbery.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt; In spite of his history of psychiatric problems, up to age 47 he had no record of violence.&lt;ref name=BP2&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121104061632/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60778169.html Train-murders suspect may have killed eight], ''The Birmingham Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The murders===
[[File:Map of region of Liguria, Italy, with provinces-it.svg|180px|thumb|left|A map showing the subdivisions within the [[Liguria]] region. Most of Bilancia's murders took place in then existing [[Province of Genoa]] (Genova) – replaced by [[Metropolitan City of Genoa]], since 2015.]]
Bilancia was a [[compulsive gambler]] who lived alone.  His first murder was the October 1997 [[strangulation]] of a friend who betrayed him by luring him into a rigged card game, in which he lost £185,000 (about $267.00).&lt;ref name=BP&gt;[https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-60779096 Gambler's betrayal led to rampage of murder], ''The Birmingham Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities originally thought this death was a heart attack.&lt;ref name=TJ&gt;[http://murderpedia.org/male.B/images/bilancia_donato/CRI-0036.pdf From crime scene analysis to offender's personality: profile-generating process: the Bilancia case], Telematic Journal of Clinical Criminology&lt;/ref&gt;  Bilancia's next two murders were the revenge shooting of the game's operator, and of his wife.&lt;ref name=occhirossi/&gt; He emptied their safe afterward.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt; Bilancia later said these first killings gave him a taste for murder.&lt;ref name=BP/&gt;  In all his killings he used or carried a .38 caliber revolver loaded with [[wad cutter]] ammunition.  He made no attempt to conceal his victims' bodies.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt; That same month, he followed a jeweller home to rob him, then shot him and his wife dead when the wife began screaming.  He emptied their safe of jewelry.&lt;ref name=occhirossi/&gt; He next robbed and murdered a [[money changer]].  Two months later, he killed a [[security guard|night watchman]] making his rounds, simply because he did not like night watchmen. He killed an Albanian prostitute and a Russian prostitute. A second money changer was killed next, shot multiple times and his safe emptied.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt; 
[[File:38 special wadcutter.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[.38 Special]] [[wadcutter]] bullets very similar to those used by Bilancia.]]
In March 1998, while receiving oral sex at gunpoint from a prostitute, he shot and killed two night watchmen who interrupted, then shot the prostitute, who survived to help develop a [[police sketch]] and later testify against him.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt; He also killed a Nigerian prostitute and a Ukrainian prostitute, and robbed and assaulted an Italian prostitute without killing her.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt; On April 12, 1998 he boarded the train from Genoa to Venice because he "wanted to kill a woman".  Spotting a young woman travelling alone, he followed her to the toilet, unlocked the door with a [[skeleton key]], shot her in the head and stole her train ticket.&lt;ref name=BP/&gt;
Six days later, he boarded the train to San Remo and followed another young woman to the toilet.  He used his key to enter, then used her jacket as a silencer and shot her behind the ear.  Excited by her black underwear, he masturbated and used her clothes to clean up.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt; The murders of two "respectable" women sparked a public outcry and the creation of a police [[task force]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/apr/14/rorycarroll No motive found as Italy's worst serial killer gets life], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last killing before his arrest, Bilancia murdered a service station attendant after filling up with petrol, then took the day's receipts, about 2 million [[lira]] (about $1000).

===Arrest and sentence===
Based on the description of the black Mercedes one of his prostitute victims was seen entering the night she was killed, police considered Bilancia "suspect number one" and followed him for ten days.  They collected his DNA from cigarette butts and a coffee cup, matching it to DNA found at crime scenes. On May 6, 1998 he was arrested at his home in Genoa and his revolver seized.&lt;ref name=Repubblica&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/online/fatti/liguria/liguria/liguria.html Serial killer, nel Dna la prova dei delitti], ''la Repubblica'' {{in lang|it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Record&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121104061645/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60566681.html  We've found the Ripper], ''Daily Record''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spiked&gt;[http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/2455/ What’s wrong with a National DNA Register?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622011326/http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/2455/ |date=June 22, 2011 }}, Spiked&lt;/ref&gt;  After eight days in police custody he confessed, speaking for two days and drawing 17 diagrams.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

On April 12, 2000, after an 11-month trial, Bilancia was sentenced to 13 terms of [[life imprisonment]] plus an additional 20 years imprisonment for the attempted murder of the prostitute who survived.&lt;ref name=CDS&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/cronache/08_febbraio_24/donato_bilancia_3402de7a-e2b4-11dc-a3c3-0003ba99c667.shtml Il doppio enigma del killer degli anonimi], ''Corriere della Sera'' {{in lang|it}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The judge ordered that he never be released.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

==Aftermath: in the media, personal goals and first temporal permission==
Bilancia's criminal life and the events that saw him as a cruel [[serial killer]] had a major impact in the [[media of Italy]]. His story inspired a [[television miniseries]], called ''Ultima pallottola'' ("The last bullet"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiction.mediaset.it/ultima-pallottola/stagione-1/|website=[[Mediaset]]|title=Ultima pallottola|accessdate=11 October 2018|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Michele Soavi]], broadcast for the first time in 2003 on [[Canale 5]], with actors [[Giulio Scarpati]], who plays as the officer during the investigations, and [[Carlo Cecchi]], as the serial killer.

In 2004 Donato Bilancia was interviewed live on [[Rai 1]] during the broadcast on ''[[Domenica in]]'', in that year conducted and hosted by [[Paolo Bonolis]]. The host received bitter criticism for the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2004/04_Aprile/25/bilancia.shtml|title=Domenica in, va in onda l'intervista al killer|language=Italian|date=25 April 2004|accessdate=11 October 2018|website=[[Corriere della Sera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cita web|url=https://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Spettacoli/2004/04_Aprile/26/bilancia.shtml|title=Bonolis, una domenica con il serial killer|language=Italian|website=[[Corriere della Sera]]|accessdate=11 October 2018|date=26 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Rai 3]] dedicated an episode to Bilancia, in the [[television show]] ''Stelle Nere'' ("Black Stars").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title = Donato Bilancia: il killer dei treni|url = https://www.raiplay.it/video/2015/02/Donato-Bilancia-il-killer-dei-treni---Stelle-nere-del-31012015-e495a1fb-45ab-4c52-b672-9c5bd683c54a.html|access-date=|series = Stelle Nere|network = [[RAI]]|date = 2015|season = 2015|url-access=registration |quote = April 1998. In less than a week, the bodies of two women barbarously killed in the baths of two trains passing through Liguria are found. Immediately the alarm goes off and with it the psychosis. It is better that women do not travel alone by train in that region. They would risk finding themselves in front of someone terribly dangerous. That "someone" is Donato Bilancia, thief, gambler but, above all, ruthless serial killer.|language = Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In prison, Bilancia has often been recognized as a "model prisoner". In 2016, after 5 years of studies, he obtained a [[diploma]] in [[accounting]] disciplines with a score of 83/100,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blitzquotidiano.it/cronaca-italia/donato-bilancia-il-serial-killer-condannato-allergastolo-si-diploma-in-carcere-2508324/|title=Donato Bilancia, il serial killer condannato all’ergastolo si diploma in carcere|language=Italian|date=12 July 2016|accessdate=11 October 2018|website=Blitz Quotidiano}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he is currently studying [[tourism]] disciplines at [[university]]. In 2017 he obtained his first temporary permit to leave the prison under armed police escort, in order to visit his parents' grave at [[Nizza Monferrato]]'s cemetery in [[Piedmont]].&lt;ref name=DB1/&gt;&lt;ref name=DB2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lastampa.it/2017/11/15/asti/il-serial-killer-donato-bilancia-accompagnato-sotto-scorta-al-cimitero-di-nizza-monferrato-sulla-tomba-della-madre-O9z1LLaDXa9k786qoLuqfL/pagina.html|title=Il serial killer Bilancia sotto scorta al cimitero di Nizza Monferrato sulla tomba della madre|date=15 November 2017|accessdate=11 October 2018|website=[[La Stampa]]|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genovaquotidiana.com/2017/11/15/la-prima-volta-del-serial-killer-bilancia-fuori-dal-carcere-scortato-va-a-visitare-la-tomba-dei-genitori/|title=La prima volta del serial killer, Bilancia fuori dal carcere (scortato) va a visitare la tomba dei genitori|date=15 November 2017|accessdate=11 October 2018|website=Genova Quotidiana|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

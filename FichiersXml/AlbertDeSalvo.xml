'''Albert Henry DeSalvo''' (September 3, 1931 – November 25, 1973) was a criminal in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] who confessed to being the "[[Boston Strangler]]", the murderer of 13 women in the Boston area from 1962 to 1964. It was widely believed that DeSalvo was imprisoned for a series of the rapes. However, his murder confession has been disputed, and debate continues as to which crimes he actually committed.

In July 2013, DNA was matched between seminal fluid found at the rape and murder of Mary Sullivan and DNA obtained from DeSalvo's nephew, linking DeSalvo to the murder of Sullivan and excluding 99.9% of the remaining population.&lt;ref name="bidgood"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jess |last=Bidgood|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/us/dna-evidence-identified-in-boston-strangler-case.html |title=50 Years Later, a Break in a Boston Strangler Case |newspaper=The New York Times |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=July 11, 2013|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities exhumed DeSalvo's remains later that month&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/12/boston-strangler-remains-desalvo/2513931/ |title=Remains unearthed of confessed Boston Strangler |newspaper=USA Today |publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Mclean, Virginia|date=July 12, 2013 |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed the DNA match.&lt;ref name="NYDN"/&gt;

==Early life==
DeSalvo was born in [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]], to Frank and Charlotte DeSalvo. His father was a violent [[alcoholic]], who at one point knocked out all of his wife's teeth and bent her fingers back until they broke in front of their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Cawthorne | first1 = Nigel | title = Serial Killers and Mass Murderers: Profiles of the World's Most Barbaric Criminals | publisher = Ulysses Press | location=Berkeley, California|date= 2007 | pages = 38–39 | isbn = 978-1569755785}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeSalvo [[zoosadism|tortured animals]] as a child, and began shoplifting and stealing in early adolescence, frequently crossing paths with the law.

In November 1943, the 12-year-old DeSalvo was first arrested for battery and robbery. In December of the same year he was sent to the [[Lyman School for Boys]]. In October 1944, he was [[parole]]d and started working as a delivery boy. In August 1946, he returned to the Lyman School for stealing an automobile. After completing his second sentence, DeSalvo joined the [[U.S. Army|Army]]. He was honorably discharged after his first tour of duty. He re-enlisted and, in spite of being tried in a [[court-martial]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} DeSalvo was again honorably discharged. DeSalvo served as a [[Military Police Corps (United States)|Military Police]] [[Sergeant#United States|Sergeant]] with the 2nd Squadron, 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eaglehorse.org/3_home_station/desalvo/desalvo.htm |title=Albert DeSalvo |publisher=Eaglehorse.org |accessdate=2013-10-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022140436/http://www.eaglehorse.org/3_home_station/desalvo/desalvo.htm |archivedate=October 22, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures of DeSalvo being arrested on February&amp;nbsp;25, 1967 show him in [[U.S. Navy]] [[Uniforms of the United States Navy#Junior enlisted sailors|Dress Blue Uniform]] with [[Petty Officer Third Class|Petty Officer 3rd Class]] ([[enlisted rank|E-4]]) insignia on his sleeve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Irving|last1=Wallace|first2=David|last2=Wallechinsky|first3=Amy|last3=Wallace|title=The Book of Lists 2|url=https://archive.org/details/bookoflists200wall|url-access=registration|chapter=12 Mass Murderers Who Got Their Start In The U.S. Armed Forces|publisher=William Morrow &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York City|date=1983|ISBN=978-0688035747|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookoflists200wall/page/40 40]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the Boston Strangler murders, DeSalvo lived at 11 Florence Street Park, in [[Malden, Massachusetts]] across the street from the junction of Florence and Clement Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/article/20130712/NEWS/307129622|title=The Malden Strangler?

==Strangler murders==
{{see also|Boston Strangler}}
Between June 14, 1962, and January 4, 1964, 13 single women between the ages of 19 and 85 were murdered in the [[Boston]] area; they were eventually tied to the Boston Strangler. Most of the women were [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] in their apartments, and then strangled with articles of clothing. The eldest victim died of a [[heart attack]]. Two others were stabbed to death, one of whom was also badly beaten. Without any sign of forced entry into their dwellings, the women were assumed to have either known their killer or voluntarily allowed him into their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Orrin|last=Grey|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-lineup/who-was-the-boston-strang_b_10130720.html|title=Who Was the Boston Strangler?|website=[[Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[Huffington Post Media Group]]|location=New York City|date=May 25, 2016|accessdate=December 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gainsborough.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Gainsborough Street, site of the first of the Boston Strangler's murders]]

In the fall of 1964, in addition to the Strangler murders, the police were also trying to solve a series of rapes committed by a man who had been dubbed the "Measuring Man" or the "Green Man". On October 27, 1964, a stranger entered a young woman's home in East Cambridge posing as a detective. He tied his victim to her bed, proceeded to sexually assault her, and suddenly left, saying "I'm sorry" as he went.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/3153/Albert-Henry-DeSalvo-Trial-1967.html|title=Albert Henry DeSalvo Trial: 1967 - Sanity Hearing, Final Arguments|website=Law Library - American Law and Legal Information|accessdate=December 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman's description led police to identify the assailant as DeSalvo. When his photo was published, many women identified him as the man who had assaulted them. Earlier on October 27, DeSalvo had posed as a motorist with car trouble and attempted to enter a home in [[Bridgewater, Massachusetts]]. The owner of the home, future [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]] Police Chief Richard Sproles, became suspicious and ultimately fired a shotgun at DeSalvo.

Under arrest for his role in the "Green Man" rapes, DeSalvo was not suspected of being involved with the murders. Only after he was charged with rape did he give a detailed confession of his activities as the Boston Strangler, both under [[hypnosis]] induced by [[William Joseph Bryan]] and also without hypnosis during interviews with Assistant Attorney General John Bottomly. He initially confessed to fellow inmate [[George Nassar]], who then notified his attorney, [[F. Lee Bailey]]. Bailey took DeSalvo's case. Though there were some inconsistencies, DeSalvo was able to cite details that had not been made public. However, there was no physical evidence to substantiate his confession. As such, he stood trial for earlier, unrelated crimes of robbery and sexual offenses. Bailey brought up the confession to the murders as part of his client's history at the trial as part of an [[insanity defense]], but it was ruled inadmissible by the judge.

For his 1967 trial, DeSalvo's mental state was evaluated by Dr. [[Harry Kozol]], a neurologist who had established the first sex offender treatment center in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E2D9133CF932A3575AC0A96E9C8B63 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first=Benedict | last=Carey | title=Harry L. Kozol, 102, Expert in Patty Hearst Trial | date=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bailey engaged a [[plea bargain]] to lock in his client's guilt in exchange for taking the [[death penalty]] off the table and also to preserve the possibility of an eventual insanity verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bardsley |first=Marilyn |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/boston/19.html |title=The Boston Strangler — Case Under Review — Crime Library on |publisher=Trutv.com |date=2001-02-23 |accessdate=2013-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204114541/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/boston/19.html |archive-date=December 4, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey was angered by the jury's decision to put DeSalvo in prison for life: "My goal was to see the Strangler wind up in a hospital, where doctors could try to find out what made him kill. Society is deprived of a study that might help deter other mass killers who lived among us, waiting for the trigger to go off inside them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bardsley |first=Marilyn |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/boston/17.html |title=The Boston Strangler — The Jury Speaks — Crime Library on |publisher=Trutv.com |date=1967-01-10 |accessdate=2013-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016071509/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/boston/17.html |archive-date=October 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment and death==
DeSalvo was sentenced to [[life in prison]] in 1967. In February of that year, he escaped with two fellow inmates from [[Bridgewater State Hospital]], triggering a full-scale manhunt. A note was found on his bunk addressed to the superintendent. In it, DeSalvo stated he had escaped to focus attention on the conditions in the hospital and his own situation. Three days after the escape he called his lawyer to turn himself in. His lawyer then sent the police to re-arrest him in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;ID TV 12-29-14 ep:7 Confessions of The Boston Strangler {{Cite episode |title=The Boston Strangler |url=http://www.aetv.com/biography/bio_episode_guide.jsp?episode=135562 |series=Biography |serieslink=Biography (TV series) |network=The Biography Channel |airdate=1987 |minutes=34:13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the escape, he was transferred to the maximum security prison known at the time as [[Massachusetts Correctional Institution - Cedar Junction|Walpole]], where he later recanted his Strangler confessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bridget|last=Murphy|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/11/massachusetts-dna-boston-strangler/2508577/|title=Officials: DNA links DeSalvo to Strangler victim|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Mclean, Virginia|date=July 11, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 1973, he was found stabbed to death in the prison infirmary. Robert Wilson, who was associated with the [[Winter Hill Gang]], was tried for DeSalvo's murder, but the trial ended in a [[hung jury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/07/archives/2d-trial-of-2-for-conspiring-to-kill-strangler-a-mistrial.html|title=2d Trial of 2 for Conspiring To Kill Strangler a Mistrial|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=March 7, 1975|accessdate=December 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey later claimed that DeSalvo was killed for selling [[amphetamine]]s in the prison for less than the inmate-enforced syndicate price.

DeSalvo's papers are housed in the [[Lloyd Sealy Library]] Special Collections at [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] in New York City. His papers include his correspondence, mainly with the members of the Bailey family, and gifts sent to the Baileys of jewelry and leatherwork crafted by DeSalvo while in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manuscript Collections|url=http://guides.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/content.php?pid=227219&amp;sid=1880539|publisher=Lloyd Sealy Library Special Collections, John Jay College of Criminal Justice|accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA evidence==
On July 11, 2013, Boston law enforcement officials announced that [[DNA]] evidence had linked DeSalvo to the rape and murder of 19-year-old Mary Sullivan. DeSalvo's remains were [[Exhumation|exhumed]], and the [[Daniel F. Conley|Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley]] said he expected investigators to find an exact match when the evidence is compared with his DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/10011124458515/dna-links-desalvo-to-mary-sullivan-s-1964-death/ |work=WHDH-TV Boston |title=DNA links DeSalvo to Mary Sullivan's 1964 death |date=July 11, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 19, 2013, Suffolk County DA [[Daniel F. Conley]], Mass. Attorney General [[Martha Coakley]] and Boston Police Commissioner [[Edward F. Davis]] announced that DNA test results proved DeSalvo was the source of seminal fluid recovered at the scene of Sullivan's 1964 murder.&lt;ref name="NYDN"&gt;DNA confirms Albert DeSalvo's link to 'Boston Strangler' killing of Mary Sullivan: authorities.

==Controversies==
{{anchor|Controversy|controversy}}

===Doubts===
Though DeSalvo was conclusively linked to Mary Sullivan's murder, doubts remain as to whether he committed all of the Boston Strangler homicides — and whether another killer could still be at large. When he confessed, people who knew him personally did not believe him capable of the crimes. It was also noted that the women allegedly killed by "The Strangler" were of widely varying ages, social strata and ethnicities, and that their deaths involved inconsistent [[modus operandi|modi operandi]].

Susan Kelly, an author who has had access to the files of the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]]' "Strangler Bureau", argued in her book that the murders were the work of several killers, rather than that of a single individual.&lt;ref name="kelly"&gt;{{cite book|first=Susan|last=Kelly|title=The Boston Stranglers: The Public Conviction of Albert Desalvo and the True Story of Eleven Shocking Murders|publisher=Citadel|location=New York City|date=October 1995|ISBN=1-55972-298-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781559722988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another author, former [[FBI]] [[offender profiling|profiler]] [[Robert Ressler]], has said, "You're putting together so many different patterns [regarding the Boston Strangler murders] that it's inconceivable behaviorally that all these could fit one individual."&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/02/14/48hours/main272108.shtml?CMP=%20ILC-SearchStories|title=The Boston Strangler|website=[[CBS News]]|publisher=[[CBS Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=February 14, 2001|accessdate=December 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Elaine Whitfield Sharp, an attorney specializing in [[forensic science|forensic]] cases from [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]], began representing the families of DeSalvo and of Mary A. Sullivan, a 19-year-old who was among the Strangler's final victims in 1964. A former print journalist, Sharp obtained court approval to exhume both Sullivan and DeSalvo for [[DNA testing]], filed several court actions to obtain information and physical evidence from the government, and worked with various film producers to create documentaries so as to better educate the public. Through these efforts, Sharp was able to identify several inconsistencies between DeSalvo's confessions and the crime scene evidence.&lt;ref name="bidgood"/&gt;

For example, DeSalvo did not, as he claimed, strangle Sullivan with his bare hands; instead, she was strangled by [[Ligature strangulation|ligature]]. [[Forensic pathology|Forensic pathologist]] [[Michael Baden]] noted that DeSalvo incorrectly stated the time of the victim's death—a  detail that DeSalvo got wrong in several of the murders, said Susan Kelly. Finally, James Starrs, professor of forensic science at [[George Washington University]], told a news conference that a semen-like substance on her body did not match DeSalvo's [[DNA]] and could not associate him with her murder.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1696552.stm |title=DNA doubts over Boston Strangler |date=December 6, 2001 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victim's nephew, Casey Sherman, also wrote a book, ''[[A Rose for Mary]]'' (2003), in which he expanded upon the evidence—and leads from Kelly's book—to conclude that DeSalvo could not be responsible for her death, and to try to determine her killer's identity.

Conley]] stated that [[DNA]] testing had revealed a "familial match" between DeSalvo and forensic evidence in the Sullivan killing, leading authorities to request the exhumation of DeSalvo's body in order to provide a definitive forensic link of DeSalvo to the murder of Mary Sullivan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Yvonne|last=Abraham |url=http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/07/11/major-development-boston-strangler-case-will-unveiled-today/AHJ5B214mZ0rSG6sxv27AI/story.html |title=Body of Albert DeSalvo, self-confessed 'Boston Strangler,' to be exhumed |publisher=Boston.com |accessdate=October 13, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714194458/http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/07/11/major-development-boston-strangler-case-will-unveiled-today/AHJ5B214mZ0rSG6sxv27AI/story.html |archivedate=July 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine days later, investigators announced that the comparison of crime scene evidence and DeSalvo's DNA "leaves no doubt that Albert DeSalvo was responsible for the brutal murder of Mary Sullivan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/19/boston-stranger-dna-test-albert-desalvo|title=Boston Strangler DNA tests confirm Albert DeSalvo killed final victim|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=19 July 2013|accessdate=9 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Nassar===
[[George Nassar]], the inmate DeSalvo reportedly confessed to, is among the suspects in the case.&lt;ref name="gerold_frank"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Gerold |last=Frank |authorlink1=Gerold Frank |title=The Boston Strangler |publisher=[[New American Library|Signet]] |location=New York City |date=1966 |isbn=0-451-16625-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/bostonstrangler00fran }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently serving a life sentence for the 1967 shooting death of an [[Andover, Massachusetts]], gas station attendant. In 2008 and again in 2009, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] denied Nassar's appeals of his 1967 conviction.&lt;ref name="Nassar2008"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Commonwealth of Massachusetts v.

Ames Robey, a former prison psychologist who analyzed both DeSalvo and Nassar, has called Nassar a [[misogynistic]], [[psychopathy|psychopathic]] killer and a far more likely suspect in the Strangler murders than DeSalvo.&lt;ref name="gerold_frank"/&gt;  Several followers of the case have also declared Nassar to be the real Strangler, claiming that he fed details of the murders to DeSalvo. DeSalvo, they speculated, knew  that he would spend the rest of his life in jail for the "Green Man" attacks, and "confessed" so that Nassar could collect reward money that they would split—thus providing support to DeSalvo's wife and two children. Another motive was his tremendous need for notoriety. DeSalvo hoped that the case would make him world-famous; Robey testified that "Albert so badly wanted to be the Strangler".&lt;ref name="gerold_frank"/&gt;

In a 1999 interview with ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Nassar denied involvement in the murders, saying that the speculation had destroyed his chances for parole. "I had nothing to do with it," he said, "I'm convicted under the table, behind the scenes."&lt;ref name="eagle tribune"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jay|last=Lindsay|url=http://www.eagletribune.com/punews/local_story_047065825.html |title=Appeal denied for jailhouse confidant of reputed Boston Strangler George Nassar convicted of Lawrence and Andover murders|newspaper=[[The Eagle-Tribune]] |publisher=[[Community Newspaper Holdings]]|date=February 16, 2008|location=North Andover, Massachusetts|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130102095949/http://www.eagletribune.com/punews/local_story_047065825.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the [[Texas]] legislature unanimously passed a resolution honoring DeSalvo for his work in "population control"—after the vote, [[Waco]] Representative [[Tom Moore, Jr.]] admitted that he had submitted the legislation as an [[April Fool's Day]] joke against his colleagues—his declared intent was to prove that they pass legislation with no [[due diligence]] given to researching the issues beforehand. Having made his point, he withdrew the resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/legal/desalvo.asp |title=Texas Legislature de Salvo Resolution |website=[[Snopes.com]] |date= |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Film
* The 1964 film ''[[The Strangler]]'', starring [[Victor Buono]], was based on the Boston Strangler Murders.
* DeSalvo was the subject of the 1968 Hollywood film ''[[The Boston Strangler (film)|The Boston Strangler]]'', starring [[Tony Curtis]] as DeSalvo, and [[Henry Fonda]] and [[George Kennedy (actor)|George Kennedy]] as the homicide detectives who apprehend him. The movie was highly fictionalized. It assumed that DeSalvo was guilty, and it portrayed him as suffering from [[multiple personality disorder]] and committing the murders while in a [[psychotic]] state. DeSalvo was never diagnosed with, nor even suspected of, having that disorder.
* The 2008 movie ''Boston Strangler: The Untold Story'', focused on DeSalvo and told the story of the Boston murders. [[David Faustino]], who played Bud Bundy on the TV series ''[[Married… with Children]]'', played DeSalvo in the film.
;Music

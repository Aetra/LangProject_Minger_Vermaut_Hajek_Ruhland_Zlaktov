'''Daniel James White''' (September 2, 1946 – October 21, 1985) was an American politician who [[moscone–Milk assassinations|assassinated]]  [[San Francisco Mayor]] [[George Moscone]] and Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]], on Monday, November 27, 1978, at [[San Francisco City Hall|City Hall]]. In a controversial verdict that led to the coining of the legal slang "[[Twinkie defense]]", White was convicted of [[manslaughter]] rather than murder in the deaths of Milk and Moscone. White served five years of a seven-year prison sentence. Less than two years after his release he returned to San Francisco, where he ultimately committed [[suicide]].

==Early life==
White was born in [[Long Beach, California]],&lt;ref&gt;"California Birth Index", hosted at ancestry. "Daniel James White, born September 2, 1946 Los Angeles County"&lt;/ref&gt; the second of nine children. He was raised by Irish-American, working-class parents in the [[Visitacion Valley, San Francisco|Visitacion Valley]] neighborhood of San Francisco.&lt;ref name=john /&gt; He attended [[Archbishop Riordan High School|Riordan High School]] until he was expelled for violence in his junior year. He went on to attend [[Wilson Classical High School|Woodrow Wilson High School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mike|last=Weiss|title=Double Play: The Hidden Passions Behind the Double Assassination of George Moscone and Harvey Milk|publisher=Vince Emery Productions|location=San Francisco, California|date=2010|pages=213–216, 474}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was [[valedictorian]] of his class.

White enlisted in the [[United States Army]] in June 1965. He was a sergeant in the [[101st Airborne Division]] in the [[Vietnam War]] from 1969 to 1970 and was honorably discharged in 1971.

White worked as a security guard at [[Dimond High School|A. J. Dimond High School]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], in 1972. He returned to San Francisco to work as a [[San Francisco Police Department|police officer]]. According to a ''[[SF Weekly]]'' newspaper account, he allegedly quit the force after reporting another officer for beating a handcuffed suspect.&lt;ref name=john&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2008-01-30/news/white-in-milk/1|title=Dan White's Motive More About Betrayal Than Homophobia|first=John|last=Geluardi|newspaper=[[SF Weekly]]|publisher=San Francisco Media Co.|location=San Francisco, California|date=January 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White then joined the [[San Francisco Fire Department]]. While on duty, according to the ''SF Weekly'' story, White's rescue of a woman and her baby from a seventh-floor apartment in the Geneva Towers was covered by the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.&lt;ref name= john /&gt; The city's newspapers referred to him as "an all-American boy".&lt;ref name=ebert&gt;{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081124/REVIEWS/811240297|title=Milk|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=November 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Election as supervisor===
In 1977, White was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] from District 8, which included several neighborhoods near the southeastern limits of San Francisco. At that time, supervisors were elected by district and not "[[at-large]]", as they had been before and then were again in the 1980s and 1990s. He had strong support from the police and firefighter unions. His district was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "a largely white, middle-class section that is hostile to the growing [[LGBT culture in San Francisco|homosexual community of San Francisco]]." ''The New York Times'' stated that as a supervisor, White saw himself as the board's "defender of the home, the family and religious life against homosexuals, [[marijuana|pot]] smokers and cynics".&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

===Tenure as supervisor===
Despite their personal differences, White and Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]] had several areas of political agreement and initially worked well together.&lt;ref name=john /&gt; Harvey Milk was one of three people from the city hall invited to the [[baptism]] of White's newborn child shortly after the election.&lt;ref name=john /&gt; White also persuaded [[Dianne Feinstein]], then president of the board of supervisors, to appoint Milk chairman of the Streets and Transportation Committee.&lt;ref name=john /&gt;

The Catholic Church in April 1978 proposed a facility for [[juvenile crime|juvenile offenders]] who had committed murder, arson, rape, and other crimes, to be operated by the [[Sisters of the Good Shepherd]], in White's district. White was strongly opposed, while Milk supported the facility, and their difference of opinion led to a conflict between the two.&lt;ref name=john /&gt; White held a mixed record on [[gay rights]], opposing the anti-gay [[Briggs Initiative]] (1978 California Proposition 6), yet voting against an ordinance prohibiting [[LGBT rights opposition|discrimination against gays]] in housing and employment.&lt;ref name=john /&gt;

==Assassinations of George Moscone and Harvey Milk==
{{Main|Moscone–Milk assassinations}}
After a disagreement over a proposed drug rehabilitation center in the Mission District, White frequently clashed with Milk, as well as other members of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harvey Milk: His Lives and Death|last=Lillian|first=Faderman|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780300222616|location=New Haven|pages=|oclc=1032649719}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 10, 1978, White resigned his seat as supervisor.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first=Wallace |last=Turner |title=Suspect Sought Job |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/28/archives/suspect-sought-job-moscone-had-been-asked-to-reappoint-him-as-a.html|work=The New York Times |date=November 28, 1978|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons he cited were his dissatisfaction with what he saw as the corrupt inner workings of San Francisco city politics, as well as the difficulty in making a living without a police officer's or firefighter's salary, jobs he could not retain legally while serving as a supervisor. White had opened a baked-potato stand at [[Pier 39]], which failed to become profitable.&lt;ref&gt;Sides, Josh. ''Erotic City: Sexual Revolutions and the Making of San Francisco''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2009. p. 164. Available at [https://archive.org/details/eroticcitysexual00side_0/page/164 Internet Archive].&lt;/ref&gt; He reversed his resignation on November 14, 1978, after his supporters lobbied him to seek reappointment from [[George Moscone]].

Moscone initially agreed to White's request, but later refused the appointment at the urging of Milk and others. On November 27, 1978, White visited [[San Francisco City Hall]] with the later-declared intention of killing not only Moscone and Milk, but also two other San Francisco politicians, California Assembly Speaker and later S.F. mayor [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]], and Supervisor [[Carol Ruth Silver]], whom he also blamed for lobbying Moscone not to reappoint him.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Mike. (September 18, 1998). "Killer of Moscone, Milk had Willie Brown on List", ''San Jose Mercury News'', Page A1&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived that day by climbing through a first-floor window on the side of City Hall carrying a [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 36]] .38 caliber revolver and 10 rounds of ammunition. By entering the building through the window, White managed to avoid the recently installed [[metal detector]]s. After entering Moscone's office, White pleaded to be reinstated as supervisor, but Moscone refused. White then killed Moscone by shooting him in the shoulder and chest, and twice in the head. He then walked to the other side of City Hall to Milk's office, reloaded the gun, and fatally shot Milk five times, the final two shots fired with the gun's barrel touching Milk's skull, according to the medical examiner. White then fled City Hall, turning himself in at the San Francisco's Northern Police Station where he had been a police officer. While being interviewed by investigators, White recorded a tearful confession, stating, "I just shot him."

===Trial and "Twinkie defense"===
{{Main|Twinkie defense}}
At the trial, White's defense team argued that his mental state at the time of the killings was one of [[diminished capacity]] due to [[major depressive disorder|depression]]. They argued, therefore, he was not capable of [[premeditation|premeditating]] the killings, and thus was not legally guilty of [[first-degree murder]]. [[Forensic psychiatry|Forensic psychiatrist]] [[Martin Blinder]] testified that White was suffering from depression and pointed to several behavioral symptoms of that depression, including the fact that White had gone from being highly health-conscious to consuming sugary foods and drinks. When the prosecution played a recording of White's confession, several jurors wept as they listened to what was described as "a man pushed beyond his endurance". Many people familiar with City Hall claimed that it was common to enter through the window to save time. A police officer friend of White claimed to reporters that several officials carried weapons at this time and speculated that White carried the extra ammunition as a habit that police officers had. The jury found White guilty of voluntary [[manslaughter]] rather than [[first-degree murder]]. Outrage within San Francisco's [[gay community]] over the resulting seven-year sentence sparked the city's [[White Night riots]]; general disdain for the outcome of the court case led to the elimination of California's "[[diminished capacity]]" law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Myth-of-the-Twinkie-defense-The-verdict-in-2511152.php |title=Myth of the 'Twinkie defense' |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 23, 2003 |accessdate=December 3, 2008 |last=Pogash |first=Carol |page=D-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/3301/Daniel-James-White-Trial-1979-Double-Execution.html |title=Daniel James White Trial: 1979 – Double Execution |accessdate=December 3, 2008 |publisher=Net Industries |work=law.jrank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]], a critic of forensic psychiatry, gave a speech to a large audience in San Francisco in June 1979 calling the White verdict a "travesty of justice" which he blamed on the diminished capacity defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winer|first1=Paul|title=Was Psychiatry Dan White's Accomplice?|url=https://archive.org/stream/noevalleyvoice06unse_1/noevalleyvoice06unse_1_djvu.txt|via=archive.org|newspaper=Noe Valley Voice|date=July 1979|accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szasz|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Szasz|title=How Dan White Got Away With Murder|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/126032684/How-Dan-White-Got-Away-With-Murder-And-How-American-Psychiatry-Helped-Him-Do-it-by-Thomas-Szasz|journal=Inquiry|accessdate=March 18, 2017|location=San Francisco, California|pages=17–21|date=August 6, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imprisonment and suicide===
[[File:Dan White headstone front.JPG|thumb|White's headstone.]]
White served five years of his seven-year sentence at [[Correctional Training Facility|Soledad State Prison]] and was paroled on January 7, 1984. Fearing White might be murdered in retaliation for his crimes, California State Corrections Officials secretly transported him to Los Angeles, where he served a year's parole. At the expiration of that year, White sought to return to San Francisco; [[Dianne Feinstein|Mayor Dianne Feinstein]] issued a public announcement of his plans, and a statement formally asking White not to return. ([[Joel Wachs#Positions|Joel Wachs]], a Los Angeles City Council member, also argued to keep White out of Los Angeles.) White did move back to San Francisco and attempted to rebuild his life with his wife and children, but his marriage soon ended.

On October 21, 1985, less than two years after his release from prison, White committed suicide by [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] in his garage. White's body was discovered by his brother, Thomas, shortly before 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.the same day.&lt;ref name=Lindsey1985&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert|last=Lindsey |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/22/us/dan-white-killer-of-san-francisco-mayor-a-suicide.html |title=Dan White, Killer Of San Francisco Mayor, A Suicide |date=October 22, 1985 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White was buried at [[Golden Gate National Cemetery]] in [[San Bruno, California]], with a traditional government-furnished headstone issued for war veterans. He was survived by his two sons, an infant daughter, and his widow.&lt;ref name=Lindsey1985 /&gt;

== Alleged confession ==
In 1998, Frank Falzon, the homicide inspector with the San Francisco police to whom White had surrendered after the killings, said that he met with White in 1984, and that at this meeting White had confessed that he had intended to kill not only Moscone and Milk, but another supervisor, [[Carol Ruth Silver]], as well as then-member of the [[California State Assembly]] and future San Francisco Mayor, [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]]. Falzon quoted White as having said, "I was on a mission. I wanted four of them. Carol Ruth Silver, she was the biggest snake ... and Willie Brown, he was masterminding the whole thing." Falzon indicated that he believed White, stating, "I felt like I had been hit by a sledge-hammer ... I found out it was a premeditated murder."&lt;ref&gt;Weiss (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The story of the assassinations is told in the [[Academy Award]]-winning documentary film ''[[The Times of Harvey Milk]]'' (1984), which came out a year before White committed suicide.

White was portrayed by [[Josh Brolin]] in the 2008 film ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]''. The film depicted White from his first meeting with Harvey Milk up to and including the assassination of Milk.&lt;ref name=john /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97518380 |title=Edelstein D. 'Milk' Is Much More Than A Martyr Movie |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=November 26, 2008 |accessdate=January 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brolin's nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] was one of eight nominations the film received overall.

White's life, the assassinations, and his trial are covered in the 1984 book ''Double Play: The San Francisco City Hall Killings'' by [[Mike Weiss (author)|Mike Weiss]], which won the [[Edgar Award]] as Best True Crime Book of the Year. An expanded second edition, ''Double Play: The Hidden Passions Behind the Double Assassination of George Moscone and Harvey Milk,'' was issued in 2010 and updated White's story to include his life after prison and his suicide. The second edition also includes a DVD with a half-hour video interview of White.

''[[Execution of Justice]],'' a play by [[Emily Mann (director)|Emily Mann]], chronicles the events leading to the assassinations. In 1999, the play was adapted to film for cable network [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], with [[Tim Daly]] portraying White.

Dan White is the subject of the punk band [[Dead Kennedys|Dead Kennedys']] cover version of "[[I Fought the Law]]", with the lyrics changed to satirize White's legal case.

The assassinations were the basis for a scene in the 1987 science fiction movie ''[[RoboCop]]'' in which a deranged former municipal official holds the Mayor of Detroit and several aides hostage and demands his job back. The situation is defused by the negotiator stalling the hostage taker until RoboCop can get upstairs and overpower him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |location=Greenwood, Connecticut |first=M.

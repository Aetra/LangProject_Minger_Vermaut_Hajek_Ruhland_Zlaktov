'''Bandali Michael Debs''' (born 18 July 1953&lt;ref name="SilkMillersentencing"/&gt;) is an [[Australian]] convicted [[serial killer]] currently serving four consecutive terms of [[life imprisonment]] plus 27 years for the murder of two [[Victoria Police]] officers in August of 1998 and for the 1997 murder of teenager Kristy Harty.&lt;ref name="HartySentencing"/&gt; Debs was detained at [[HM Prison Barwon]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].  On 12 December 2011 he was convicted of the April 1995 shooting murder of New South Wales sex worker Donna Ann Hicks.&lt;ref name="Age" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hicksMurder"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/09/3061726.htm |title=Man charged 15 years after prostitute's murder |date=9 November 2010 |website=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |access-date=26 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is portrayed by Australian actor [[Greg Stone]] in the telemovie ''[[Underbelly Files: Tell Them Lucifer was Here]]''.

==Personal life==
Debs, from [[Narre Warren, Victoria|Narre Warren]], a south eastern suburb of Melbourne was employed as a [[tiler]]. He had fathered five children. His youngest son Joseph was found dead due to a suspected [[drug overdose]] at a house in [[Greensborough, Victoria|Greensborough]] in December 2003.&lt;ref name="youngsondead"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/23/1071941733330.html |title=Debs's youngest son found dead |first1=Chris |last1=Evans |first2=John |last2=Silvester |date=24 December 2003 |newspaper=[[The Age]] |access-date=26 November 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031225055430/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/23/1071941733330.html |archive-date=25 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Silk-Miller police murders}}

In February, 2003, Debs was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment with no minimum term for the murders of two Victoria Police officers, Sergeant Gary Silk and Senior Constable Rodney Miller at [[Moorabbin, Victoria]] on 16 August 1998.&lt;ref name=HartySentencing/&gt;

Accomplice Jason Joseph Roberts, who was 22 at the time of sentencing, was also convicted of the police murders and sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment with a minimum term of 35 years.

==Murder of Kristy Harty==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:KHarty.jpg|right|thumb|Kristy Harty]{{deletable image-caption|Monday, 11 June 2018|PROD}}]] --&gt;
On 20 June 2005, police charged Debs with the murder of troubled teenager Kristy Mary Harty,&lt;ref name="dnalink"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/dna-tests-link-debs-to-prostitute-death/2005/07/20/1121539031258.html |title=DNA tests link Debs to prostitute death |first1=John |last1=Silvester |first2=Stephen |last2=Moynihan |date=21 July 2005 |newspaper=[[Herald Sun]] |access-date=26 November 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050722034456/http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/dna-tests-link-debs-to-prostitute-death/2005/07/20/1121539031258.html |archive-date=22 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was murdered at [[Beaconsfield, Victoria|Upper Beaconsfield]] on 17 June 1997.

Harty was [[soliciting]] for sex along the [[Princes Highway]] when she met with Debs. The pair drove to a secluded bush track in Upper Beaconsfield where they had [[unprotected sex]]. Harty was later murdered. Her semi-naked body was found lying face down by bushwalkers. A single gunshot wound was discovered at the rear of her head.&lt;ref name="noparole"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21913015-2862,00.html |title=No-parole call on Debs |first=Emily |last=Power |date=21 July 2005 |newspaper=Herald Sun |access-date=26 November 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906021947/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21913015-2862,00.html |archive-date=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DNA]] tests revealed [[semen]] located on the body of Harty that was linked to Debs.

In May 2007, Debs was convicted of the murder of Harty and sentenced to a third consecutive term of life imprisonment.&lt;ref name=HartySentencing/&gt;

In sentencing Debs, Justice Kaye remarked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Your murder of Ms Harty was entirely [[senseless violence|senseless]], needless and wanton. The evidence discloses beyond any doubt that this was not a case of a sexual encounter in which, in the heat of the moment, feelings or passions may have led to a spontaneous and irrational act of violence. Rather, and quite to the contrary, this was, most clearly, a callous, craven and senseless murder in cold blood of an entirely innocent, defenceless and vulnerable young woman. The evidence leads to the inevitable conclusion that you murdered Kristy Harty for no other reason than for the sheer sake of it.&lt;ref name=HartySentencing/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Murder of Donna Anne Hicks==

Donna Anne Hicks was shot dead in April 1995 in western [[Sydney]].

Debs was subsequently linked to the case through [[DNA analysis]]. Debs had been entered into a DNA database of criminals. On 30 September 2008, Melbourne detectives interviewed Debs and raided his previous address in Sydney.&lt;ref name="hickscase"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/jailed-killer-debs-linked-to-1995-sydney-murder-20080930-4r87.html |title=Jailed killer Debs linked to 1995 Sydney murder |first=John |last=Silvester |date=1 October 2008 |newspaper=The Age |access-date=26 November 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081104112334/http://www.theage.com.au/national/jailed-killer-debs-linked-to-1995-sydney-murder-20080930-4r87.html |archive-date=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December 2011 he was found guilty of Hicks' murder in the New South Wales Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Age"/&gt; He was sentenced to a fourth consecutive life term for the murder.

==Prison life==
While imprisoned, Debs has undertaken psychology, life skills and computer training and is employed as a prison carpet cleaner.&lt;ref name=noparole/&gt;

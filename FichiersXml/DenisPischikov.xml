'''Denis Sergeevich Pischikov '''(born April 12, 1983 in Bulanash, [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]], [[RSFSR]]), known as "'''The Shivering Creature'''"[why?], is a [[Russia]]n robber and [[serial killer]], who killed 14 elderly people between 2002 and 2003 in the [[Moscow Oblast]] and [[Vladimir Oblast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vsrf.ru/stor_pdf.php?id=99426|title=Кассационное определение по делу Писчикова}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Pischikov was born on April 12, 1983 in a loving family in the settlement of Bulanash, Svedlovsk Oblast, but was born with a [[congenital disease]]. His childhood was happy, but after the [[collapse of the USSR]] his father was left without work and soon died. All of the family's worries fell upon the shoulders of the mother, Lyuba Ivanovna, who worked at the Artyomovsk radio plant, who did not notice how her son was straying from the right path. Soon she married Alexander Anushin, an electric locomotive driver, but he turned out to be an alcoholic who did not even try to establish relationships with the child. Pischikov left school after the 5th grade, repeatedly running into the police for theft and [[hooliganism]]. Outwardly, he appeared to be a modest and shy boy.

Pischikov came to [[Moscow]] in June 2000.&lt;ref name="Губерния"&gt;{{cite web|author=Александр ТАРАСОВ.|year=2008|url=http://www.rpgazeta.ru/index2.php3?path=htm/2008/50&amp;source=7642|title=Идет маньяк по улице…|trans-title=There is a maniac on the street ...|publisher=Электронная газета "Губернiя"|accessdate=2010-04-19|language=ru|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he was arrested for attempting to steal the radio from a car. However, the mask of a modest fellow helped him, and he, having signed a written undertaking not to leave, disappeared. He was declared wanted on the federal list, but was not sought after seriously. Pischikov at first settled in the Vladimir Oblast with his friend, but soon after, he met a girl, with whom he began to live. At first, he worked on the construction of country houses, then at a tire store, but did not stay there for a long time. Subsequently, he deceived his partner that he worked, bringing home the money that he took from the homes of the retirees he killed.

The first murder carried out by Pischikov occurred on March 29, 2002 in the village of Pashnevo, in the [[Orekhovo-Zuyevsky District]]. He stole 3000 [[rubles]] from the house of the murdered pensioner Lebedev. The next murder occurred on November 8, 2002, in the village of Potochino, Moscow Oblast, but this time he had a smaller bounty of 700 rubles. He killed the next victim on January 17, 2003, but could not steal any money, since he did not find any in the house.

In a number of cases, Pischikov also took food from the refrigerator of the pensioners he killed, sometimes even while at the crime scenes. On March 18, 2003, Pischikov committed two consecutive murders in the village of Gubin in the Orekhovo-Zuevsky District, stealing 950 rubles and a piece of sausage. On March 31 of the same year, Pischikov committed two more murders in the village of Korovino, again in the Orekhovo-Zuevsky District, stealing a total of 1120 rubles from both murders. This suggested that Pischikov was not robbing - he was killing instead. On April 3, 2003, Pischikov committed his last murder in the village of Voinova Gora, killing a pensioner and his 50-year-old daughter. However, the daughter miraculously had survived.

Pischikov was arrested in the city of [[Likino-Dulyovo]]. When he was walking along the street and looking for another place to burglarize, he was noticed by a pensioner. He called the police and, at his own risk, began to pursue the perpetrator. Soon, Pischikov was arrested on a deserted street. He began to give evidence on the way to the police station, confessing to all the murders. He however did not repent to the questioners, and according to the investigators' stories: "''Pischikov did not even understand what else they wanted from him, except his cooperation with the investigation"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Дэвид Гамбург.|url=http://line-tv.ru/tv-peredachi/4439-kriminalnaja-rossija-tvar-drozhashhaja-smotret.html|date=2005|title=Документальный фильм из цикла "Криминальная Россия" - "Тварь дрожащая"|trans-title="A documentary from the series" Criminal Russia "-" The Creation of a Shivering " "|publisher=[[Первый канал (Россия)|Первый канал]]|accessdate=2010-04-19|language=ru|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/678fSEZ2L?url=http://line-tv.ru/tv-peredachi/4439-kriminalnaja-rossija-tvar-drozhashhaja-smotret.html|archivedate=2012-04-23|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, the court sentenced Denis Pischikov to [[life imprisonment]]. In a petition for [[clemency]], he wrote: "''Have pity on me! Anything but life!''". The [[Supreme Court of Russia]] upheld the verdict without change, after which Pischikov was sent to the [[White Swan (prison)|White Swan]] prison.

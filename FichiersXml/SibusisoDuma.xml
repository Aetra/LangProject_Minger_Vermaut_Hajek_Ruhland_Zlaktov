'''Sibusiso Derrick Duma''' (born 6 May 1984) is a [[South Africa]]n [[serial killer]] who was convicted of two murders in 2007 and five murders in 2009 and sentenced to 8 [[Life Sentence|life sentence]]s in prison.&lt;ref name="Sentence"&gt;[http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Life-in-jail-for-serial-killer-20090817. ‘‘News 24’’ : Life in jail for Serial Killer.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was mostly active around the town of [[Pietermaritzburg]], [[KwaZulu Natal]].

Duma is a violent [[psychopathy|psychopath]] who partook of [[theft]], [[kidnapping]], [[torture]], [[rape]] and [[murder]]. He worked as a [[Share taxi|taxi driver]] and used his vehicle as a weapon on occasion as well as to obtain his victims. Duma’s reasoning, victimology and methodology changed sometimes from victim to victim, indicating that he was a [[disorganized offender|disorganized killer]]. 

Duma first killed on September 9, 2007 when he used his minibus taxi to run over and kill a Department of Education security guard, Mqeku Zondi. Duma had been hired to drive Mr. Zondi to his residence for an agreed upon fee. The conductor of Duma’s taxi, Mlungisi Bhengu, testified that Zondi reneged on paying the fare for some of the journey, at which point "Duma drove into the old man, ran over him with the wheels of the taxi and then reversed over his body again".&lt;ref name="Journalist"&gt;[http://www.thestar.co.za/?fSectionId=&amp;fArticleId=vn20090804122349860C600248. ‘‘The Saturday Star’’ : Jailed Killer denies killer rampage.]&lt;/ref&gt; Duma then robbed the victim of his remaining money and a 9mm [[Norinco]] pistol.
 
On the evening of October 14, 2007, Duma and his accomplice, Simphiwe Khesi, had been drinking at a local [[shebeen]]. Leaving a little after 19:00, the men realised that there would be no taxis available, so they planned to [[carjacking|hijack]] a vehicle in order to get home.&lt;ref name="Drinking"&gt;[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=15&amp;art_id=vn20071115033645135C710001#more. ‘‘iol’’ : Killers laugh at jail term.]&lt;/ref&gt; Finding a suitable vehicle, Duma shot and killed the driver, First National Bank employee Patricia Kippen (39). The shooting brought attention from nearby residents, causing the duo to abandon the vehicle. They soon found another possible target vehicle, shooting and killing the driver, former [[The Witness (South African newspaper)|Witness]] crime journalist, Elaine Anderson (59).&lt;ref name="Journalist"/&gt; 

On October 19, 2007, Duma raped, shot and murdered Hlengiwe Shangase. Duma had waited near her home before dragging her to a desolate area and raping her. He then shot her in the head at point blank range using the [[Norinco]] pistol he had stolen from Mqeku Zondi.&lt;ref name="Journalist"/&gt; 

The following day, Duma [[carjacking|hijacked]], shot and killed two men; Masizane Mtshatsha and Thamsanqua Mbindwane. An hour later, now driving in the [[carjacking|hijacked]] VW Polo, Duma kidnapped three further victims; Tsepo Mhlongo, Linda Jali and a teenage girl. The two men were robbed, ordered out of the vehicle, shot and left for dead. Duma with his accomplice, Simphiwe Khesi, took the young girl to Azalea Cemetery where they [[gang rape|rape]]d her. Duma then drove the stolen car over the girl multiple times in order to kill her.&lt;ref name="Journalist"/&gt;

Finally, on October 25, 2007, Duma kidnapped, robbed, raped and murdered Pinetown teacher, Noxolo Dlamini. 

Duma was originally charged, convicted and sentenced along with Simphiwe Khesi for the murders of Kippen and Anderson on November 14, 2007. Judge President Vuka Tshabalala sentenced the men to 15 years each for attempting to rob Anderson and sentenced Duma to 15 years for robbing Kippen and Khesi 20 years, in addition to the life sentences for murder. Both men laughed when sentenced saying, "They're dead now. What are they worrying about?"&lt;ref name="Drinking"/&gt;

On August 4, 2009, Duma was further charged in connection with his various other crimes. On August 17, 2009, Acting Judge Kobus Booyens imposed a further six life sentences and prison terms totaling 104 years. He said he intends that Duma should be permanently removed from society.&lt;ref name="Sentence2"&gt;[http://serialkillerstalk.web-log.nl/. ‘‘Serial Killers Talk’’ : He must never leave jail.]&lt;/ref&gt;

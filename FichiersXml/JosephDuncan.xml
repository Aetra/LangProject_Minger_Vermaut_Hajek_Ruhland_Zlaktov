'''Joseph Edward Duncan III''' (born February 25, 1963) is an American convicted [[serial killer]] and [[child molester]] who is on [[death row]] in federal prison in conjunction with the 2005 kidnappings and murders of members of the Groene family of [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]]. He is also serving 11 consecutive sentences of [[life imprisonment|life without parole]] in conjunction with the same crimes as well as the 1997 murder of Anthony Martinez of [[Beaumont, California]].&lt;ref name=SeaTimes20080828&gt;{{cite web|last=Boone|first=Rebecca|title=Duncan sentenced to death|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008143479_duncan28.html|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]]|location=Seattle, Washington|accessdate=March 17, 2011|date=August 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Duncan has confessed to — but has not been charged with — the 1996 murder of two girls in [[Seattle]].&lt;ref name=KOMO_20110315&gt;{{cite web|title=Idaho killer Duncan pleads guilty to 1997 Calif. murder|url=http://www.komonews.com/news/local/118044069.html|publisher=KOMO-TV|accessdate=March 16, 2011|location=Seattle, Washington|date=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the attack on the Groene family, Duncan was on the run from a child molestation charge in [[Minnesota]].

Born in [[Tacoma, Washington]], Duncan's criminal history dates to when he was 15 years old. In 1980, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for [[sexual assault|sexually assaulting]] a boy in Tacoma and as a result has spent all but six years of his adult life in prison. He was paroled in 1994 but was returned to prison in 1997 for violating the terms of his parole.&lt;ref name=S-R_HarmDie&gt;{{cite news|title=My intent is to harm...then die|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2005/jul/03/my-intent-is-to-harm-then-die/|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|location=Spokane, Washington|date=July 3, 2005|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, [[Kootenai County, Idaho]], authorities discovered the bodies of Brenda Groene, her boyfriend, and her 13-year-old son in the family home near Coeur d'Alene.&lt;ref name=S-R_ClueHom&gt;{{cite web|last=Drumheller|first=Susan|title=Man may hold clue to homicides|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=70180|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|accessdate=March 17, 2011|location=Spokane, Washington|date=May 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities also noted that Groene's two other children were missing: Shasta, 8,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Shasta Groene | work = Missing Children | publisher = America's Most Wanted | date = 2005 | url = http://www.amw.com/missing_children/brief.cfm?id=32043 | accessdate = April 7, 2012 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120224012527/http://www.amw.com/missing_children/brief.cfm?id=32043 | archivedate = February 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dylan, 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dylan Groene | work = Missing Children | publisher = America's Most Wanted | date = 2005 | url = http://www.amw.com/missing_children/brief.cfm?id=32037 | accessdate = April 7, 2012 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120224012457/http://www.amw.com/missing_children/brief.cfm?id=32037 | archivedate = February 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After an intense search for the two children, Shasta was found alive with Duncan at a restaurant in Coeur d'Alene nearly seven weeks later, and Duncan was arrested in conjunction with her kidnapping. When the authorities rescued Shasta, she told them that Duncan said that he was bringing her back to her father because Duncan had changed his mind about killing her. She said that Duncan stated that she taught him how to love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Betsy Z.|last=Russell|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2008/aug/19/gps-trail-shows-duncans-path/|title=GPS trail shows Duncan's path|date=August 19, 2008|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|location=Spokane, Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan's remains were found days later in a remote area near [[St. Regis, Montana]]. Duncan was subsequently charged with murdering Dylan as well as the three victims at the Coeur d'Alene home.

During his incarceration, authorities connected Duncan with the unsolved murders of Anthony Martinez in California and two girls in Seattle, which all occurred during Duncan's parole from 1994–1997. Of those murders, Duncan has only been charged in the California case. In all, Duncan has been convicted in Idaho for kidnapping and murdering the three victims in Coeur d'Alene, for which he was given six life sentences;&lt;ref name=S-R_DuncanGuilt&gt;{{cite newspaper|last=Brodwater|first=Taryn|title=Duncan admits guilt|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=154916|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|location=Spokane, Washington|accessdate=March 17, 2011|date=October 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[United States federal courts|federal court]] for kidnapping Shasta and Dylan Groene and murdering Dylan,&lt;ref name=S-RDuncanDie&gt;{{cite news|first1=Meghann|last1=Cuniff|first2=Betzy Z.|last2=Russell|title=Joseph Duncan sentenced to die|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=258599|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|accessdate=March 17, 2011|location=Spokane, Washington|date=August 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he was given three death sentences and three life sentences; and in the state of California for kidnapping and murdering Martinez, for which he was given two life sentences.

==Early criminal history==
Duncan has a long history as a violent sexual predator. He committed his first recorded sex crime in 1978 in his hometown of Tacoma, Washington, when he was 15 years old. In that incident, he [[rape]]d a nine-year-old boy at gunpoint. The following year, he was arrested driving a stolen car. He was sentenced as a juvenile and sent to Dyslin's Boys' ranch in Tacoma, where, according to a report by the [[Associated Press]], he told a therapist who was assigned to his case that he had bound and [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] six boys. He also told the therapist that he estimated that he had raped 13 younger boys by the time he was 16.&lt;ref name=S-RPsychopath&gt;{{cite news|last=Roesler|first=Richard|title=Duncan's History: By age 17 he fit definition of a ''sexual psychopath''|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=78674|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|location=Spokane, Washington|date=July 6, 2005|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, also in Tacoma, Duncan stole a number of guns from a neighbor and then abducted a 14-year-old boy and raped him at gunpoint. Duncan was sentenced to 20 years in prison for this crime, but was released on parole in 1994 after serving 14 years.&lt;ref name=S-R_HarmDie /&gt; While out on parole, Duncan is known to have lived in several places in the Seattle area. He was arrested again in 1996 — this time for [[marijuana]] use — and released on parole several weeks later with new restrictions.&lt;ref name=S-RTimeline&gt;{{cite web|title=Probation records reveal Duncan's travels|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=83414|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|location=Spokane, Washington|accessdate=March 17, 2011|date=August 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities believe that during his parole Duncan murdered Sammiejo White and Carmen Cubias in Seattle in 1996 and Anthony Martinez in [[Riverside County, California]] in 1997; however, both those cases went [[Cold case (criminology)|cold]] and were not tied to Duncan until after his arrest in the Groene case. Duncan was arrested in Kansas and returned to prison in 1997 after violating the terms of his parole;&lt;ref name=S-R_HarmDie /&gt;&lt;ref name=S-RTimeline /&gt; he was released from prison on July 14, 2000 with time off for good behavior&lt;ref name=S-RTimeline /&gt; and moved to [[Fargo, North Dakota]].&lt;ref name=SeaTimes20050712&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/fargo-businessman-helped-idaho-suspect-make-bail/ | title=Fargo businessman helped Idaho suspect make bail | newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] | publisher=[[Seattle Times Company]]|location=Seattle, Washington|date=July 12, 2005|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, Duncan was charged with the July 3, 2004 [[child molestation|molestation]] of two boys at a playground in [[Detroit Lakes, Minnesota]]. On April 5, 2005, he appeared before a [[Becker County, Minnesota|Becker County]] judge, who set bail at US$15,000.&lt;ref name=S-RTroubleFree&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Hagengruber|title=25 trouble-free years end|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=79444|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|location=Spokane, Washington|date=July 10, 2005|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Fargo businessman with whom Duncan had become acquainted helped him [[Posting bail|post bail]]; however, Duncan skipped bail and disappeared.&lt;ref name=SeaTimes20060217 /&gt; On June 1, 2005, a federal warrant was issued for Duncan's arrest on the charge of "unlawful flight to avoid prosecution."&lt;ref name=S-RInvDylan&gt;{{cite news|first=Susan|last=Drumheller|title=Investigation turns to Dylan|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=78447|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|location=Seattle, Washington|date=July 4, 2005|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Idaho murders and kidnappings ==
On May 16, 2005,    authorities discovered the bodies of Brenda Groene, 40; her boyfriend, Mark McKenzie, 37; and her son, Slade Groene, 13, in their home along [[Lake Coeur d'Alene]], outside the city of Coeur d'Alene.&lt;ref name=S-R_ClueHom /&gt; Two of Brenda Groene's other children, Dylan, 9, and Shasta, 8, were missing. An [[AMBER Alert]] was issued and searchers combed the area for the missing children while authorities investigated the deaths at the home as homicides.&lt;ref name=S-R_ClueHom /&gt; [[Autopsy|Autopsies]] determined the cause of death to be "blunt trauma to the head"; authorities also noted that the victims had been bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drumheller|first=Susan|title=Victims in CdA homicide were bludgeoned|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=70581|work=The Spokesman-Review|accessdate=March 17, 2011|author2=Curless, Erica|location=Spokane, Washington|date=May 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven weeks later, in the early morning hours of July 2, 2005, Shasta Groene was seen at a [[Denny's]] restaurant in Coeur d'Alene in the company of an unknown man. A waitress, manager, and two customers at the restaurant recognized Shasta from media reports. They surreptitiously called police and positioned themselves to prevent the man from leaving.&lt;ref name=S-RNightDrama&gt;{{cite web|last=Hagengruber|first=James|title=Tense late-night drama ends quietly, safely|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=78347|work=The Spokesman-Review|accessdate=March 17, 2011|author2=Drumheller, Susan|location=Spokane, Washington|date=July 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police officers arrived at the restaurant and arrested the man, later identified as Duncan, without incident.&lt;ref name=S-RNightDrama /&gt; Shasta Groene identified herself to a waitress at the restaurant and to authorities, and was taken to Kootenai Medical Center for medical treatment and to be reunited with her father.&lt;ref name=S-RInvDylan /&gt; Coeur d'Alene police, meanwhile, detained Duncan on [[kidnapping]] charges and on his outstanding federal warrant.&lt;ref name=S-RInvDylan /&gt;

When Shasta Groene was found without Dylan, authorities held little hope of finding the boy alive. Police asked the public for tips, specifically with respect to sightings of the stolen red [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] with Missouri license plates that Duncan was driving at the time of his arrest.&lt;ref name=S-RRemains&gt;{{cite web|last=Drumheller|first=Susan|title=Western Montana remains are likely those of Dylan|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=78511|work=The Spokesman-Review|accessdate=March 17, 2011|location=Spokane, Washington|date=July 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities discovered that Duncan had rented the car in Minnesota and never returned it. A gas station employee in [[Kellogg, Idaho|Kellogg]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} east of Coeur d'Alene, recognized the vehicle as one that had stopped at her station hours before Duncan was arrested.&lt;ref name=S-RRemains/&gt; The employee suspected the girl wandering around the station might have been Shasta, but did not confront her, as nothing appeared out of the ordinary. The employee and her manager notified authorities after reviewing surveillance camera footage and identifying Duncan and Shasta in the video.&lt;ref name=S-RRemains/&gt;

On July 4, 2005, investigators found human remains at a remote makeshift campsite in the [[Lolo National Forest]] near [[St. Regis, Montana|St. Regis]], Montana.&lt;ref name=S-RDylanConfirm&gt;{{cite web|last=Shors|first=Benjamin|title=Remains are Dylan's|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=79500|work=The Spokesman-Review|accessdate=March 17, 2011|location=Spokane, Washington|date=July 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains were sent to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] lab in [[Quantico, Virginia|Quantico]], [[Virginia]] for DNA testing and were positively identified as those of Dylan Groene.&lt;ref name=S-RDylanConfirm /&gt; During the trial it emerged that Duncan shot Dylan Groene at point-blank range by holding a sawed-off 12-gauge shotgun to his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2008/aug/16/tapes-show-duncan-with-kids-at-campsite/|title=Tapes show Duncan with kids at campsite|date=16 Aug 2008|website=The Spokesman-Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groene family murders===
Much of what is known about the murders of the Groene family was revealed by Shasta Groene herself. According to Shasta Groene's police interview, Duncan killed her mother, older brother, and her mother's fiancé, and then kidnapped her and her brother, driving away with them in his red Jeep Cherokee.

Shasta told investigators her mother called her into the living room, where she saw Duncan wearing black gloves and holding a gun. Her captor tied her mother's hands with nylon zip ties, and did the same to her mother's fiancé and her brother Slade. Shasta and Dylan were removed from the house and placed inside the stolen rental car. While she waited with her brother, she heard her mother's fiancé scream out and then saw her injured older brother staggering away from the entrance to the home. Duncan then bludgeoned the three to death; neither Shasta nor Dylan witnessed the murders. Both Shasta and Dylan were taken to other locations, where they were repeatedly molested and tortured for six weeks. She said that they drove a long distance and stayed in two different campsites, where Duncan told her of having beaten her family members to death with a hammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shasta also told investigators how Dylan was murdered. Duncan insisted that Dylan's death was an accident. Initially, Shasta was standing on the other side of Duncan's Jeep when she heard a loud boom. She then ran to the other side of the Jeep where she saw Dylan lying on the ground screaming. Duncan was apparently digging through a clear plastic box looking for beer, when a shotgun that was also kept in the box went off, hitting Dylan in the stomach. Shasta said that she then saw Duncan put the shotgun to Dylan's head and pull the trigger, but it failed to go off. While Dylan begged Duncan not to kill him, Duncan reloaded the shotgun, put it back to the boy's head and pulled the trigger&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2008/aug/20/duncan-alternately-kind-cruel-shasta-says/|title=Duncan alternately kind, cruel, Shasta says|date=20 Aug 2008|website=The Spokesman-Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Dylan was killed instantly. According to Shasta, immediately after killing Dylan, Duncan started crying and told her that he only killed him to put him out of his misery. A public memorial service was held for Dylan on July 16, 2005, which would have been his 10th birthday. It was held in Building 2 of [http://www.reallifeministries.com/ Real Life Ministries], [https://www.google.com/maps/@47.7259153,-116.9050519,3a,75y,51.99h,88.08t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sHcfXfL0ttJ08UWo2efh9GA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 1866 N Cecil Rd, Post Falls, ID 83854, USA].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2005/jul/16/service-for-dylan-today/|title=Service for Dylan today|date=16 July 2005|website=The Spokesman-Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shasta also reported that Duncan nearly killed her days after killing Dylan. She said he gave her the choice to be killed either by strangulation or with a gun. Shasta chose the former, and Duncan proceeded to wrap a rope around her neck and pull it tight. However, Shasta begged Duncan to stop, using his nickname, "Jet", and he immediately did. He then asked her if she would like to meet his mother, to which she responded yes, and the two drove back towards Coeur d'Alene and stopped at the Denny's restaurant where Shasta was rescued.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZttD-myqdaw&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other crimes==
Duncan's arrest led the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to launch a nationwide review of unsolved missing child cases. He was implicated as a possible suspect in several crimes that occurred between 1994 and 1997, when he was on parole, and between 2000 and 2005, when he was free from prison. Although he was cleared as a suspect in some cases, authorities in California and Washington had enough evidence to believe Duncan had committed unsolved murders in their jurisdictions.

===Anthony Martinez===
On April 4, 1997, 10-year-old Anthony Michael Martinez was playing with friends in the front yard of his home in Beaumont, California, when an unknown man approached the group asking for help finding a missing cat. When the boys refused, the man grabbed Martinez at knifepoint and threw him into his vehicle.&lt;ref name=SeaTimes20060217&gt;{{cite news

Investigators noted that he had been sexually assaulted and bound with duct tape.&lt;ref name=SeaTimes20060217/&gt; Although a [[Facial composite|composite sketch]] of the suspect was made available and a partial fingerprint taken from the duct tape found on Martinez's body, the case eventually went cold.

In July 2005, bloggers noticed similarities between Duncan and the composite sketch in the Martinez case, as well as between Duncan's vehicle and the one Martinez's assailant was driving.&lt;ref name=SeaTimes20060217/&gt; The FBI and [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] became involved, and in turn contacted Riverside County authorities. Riverside authorities were able to match the fingerprint taken from Martinez's body to Duncan, and on August 3 the [[Riverside County Sheriff's Department|Riverside County Sheriff]] officially announced Duncan's connection with the Martinez case.

===Sammiejo White and Carmen Cubias===
Federal prosecutors also revealed that Duncan confessed to the murders of Sammiejo White, 11, and her sister, Carmen Cubias, 9, who vanished on July 6, 1996, after leaving the Crest Motel in Seattle to panhandle.  Their remains were found on February 10, 1998, in [[Bothell, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Trials==
Duncan has been convicted by three courts; an Idaho district court, for the kidnapping and murders of Brenda and Slade Groene and Mark McKenzie; the [[United States District Court for the District of Idaho]], for the kidnapping of Shasta and Dylan Groene, the murder of Dylan Groene, and other crimes; and a California superior court, for the kidnapping and murder of Anthony Martinez.

===Idaho===
Duncan first appeared in a Kootenai County court on July 13, 2005, where he was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of first degree kidnapping, all in conjunction with the deaths of Brenda and Slade Groene and Mark McKenzie.&lt;ref name=S-RDuncCharges&gt;{{cite web|last=Drumheller|first=Susan|title=Duncan hears his charges|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=79966|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011|location=Spokane, Washington|date=July 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kootenai County prosecutors had initially planned to charge Duncan with the kidnappings of Shasta and Dylan Groene; however, they deferred those charges to the federal courts, as transporting children across state lines for the purpose of sexual exploitation is a federal offense.&lt;ref name=S-RDuncCharges /&gt; Trial was set to begin on January 17, 2006, but was delayed until April 4, after the district judge granted a request to the defense for more time to prepare for the trial, and then again to October 26, after the judge in the case stated that "No one wants to try this case twice, including me."&lt;ref name=S-RDelayAgain&gt;{{cite web|last=Brodwater|first=Taryn|title=Duncan trial delayed again|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=118084|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011|location=Spokane, Washington|date=February 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan's attorneys blamed the multiple postponements on the prosecution's insistence on pursuing the death penalty.&lt;ref name=S-RDelayAgain/&gt;

On October 16, 2006, shortly after jury selection began, Kootenai County prosecutors and Duncan's attorney reached a plea bargain in which Duncan pleaded guilty to all state charges against him.&lt;ref name=S-R_IDdeal&gt;{{cite web|last=Brodwater|first=Taryn|title=Duncan admits guilt|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=154916|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011|location=Spokane, Washington|date=October 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was immediately sentenced to three consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole for the three kidnapping charges.&lt;ref name=S-R_IDdeal /&gt; Sentencing on the three murder charges was continued pending the outcome of his federal trial on kidnapping and murder charges; the judge said that if he did not receive the death penalty on the federal charges, he would return to Kootenai County for a death penalty phase on the state murder charges.&lt;ref name=S-R_IDdeal /&gt; Over two years later, after being sentenced to death on federal charges, Kootenai County sentenced Duncan to three additional life sentences.&lt;ref name=FNN_6Life&gt;{{cite web|title=Convicted Child-Killer Joseph Duncan Gets 6 Life Sentences|url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/convicted-child-killer-joseph-duncan-gets-6-life-sentences|work=[[Fox News]]|publisher=[[News Corp (2013–present)|News Corp]]|location=New York City|accessdate=March 30, 2011|date=November 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Duncan also agreed to cooperate with Kootenai County sheriff's detectives investigating his crimes and provide passwords to [[encryption|encrypted]] files stored on his computer.&lt;ref name=S-R_IDdeal /&gt;

===Federal===
On January 18, 2007, Duncan was indicted by a federal [[grand jury]] in Coeur d'Alene on 10 counts of "kidnapping, kidnapping resulting in death, aggravated sexual abuse of a minor, and sexual exploitation of a child resulting in death," and other crimes related to illegal firearm possession and vehicle theft.&lt;ref name=S-RFedArraign&gt;{{cite news|last=Russell|first=Betsy Z.|title=Duncan lawyer to seek delay|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=170108|accessdate=March 18, 2011|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|date=January 20, 2007|location=Spokane, Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arraigned the following day at a federal court in Boise, Idaho, where a judge ordered Duncan to stand trial the following March.&lt;ref name=S-RFedArraign /&gt; Duncan's defense attorneys immediately requested a postponement,&lt;ref name=S-RFedArraign /&gt; which was granted the week the trial was originally scheduled to begin; a new trial date was set for January 22, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brodwater|first=Taryn|title=Duncan's next trial set for January|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=180712|accessdate=March 18, 2011|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|date=March 23, 2007|location=Spokane, Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, 2007, Duncan pleaded guilty to all 10 charges against him.&lt;ref name=S-RFedDeal&gt;{{cite news|last=Russell|first=Betsy Z.|title=Shasta won't need to testify|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=222723|accessdate=March 18, 2011|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|date=December 7, 2007|location=Spokane, Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a condition of the agreement, Shasta Groene would not have to testify in the penalty phase of the trial. Due to a [[gag order]], other details of the plea agreement were not released.&lt;ref name=S-RFedDeal /&gt;

Jury selection for the penalty phase for Duncan's federal trial began on April 14, 2008. During jury selection, Duncan dismissed his attorneys and chose to represent himself.  His attorneys objected, asserting he was not competent to do so, and requested a formal hearing as to the issue.  The district court ordered an evaluation of Duncan to determine his competence, and accepted the evaluator's conclusion that he was competent to proceed without counsel.&lt;ref name="ca9.uscourts"&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2011/07/11/08-99031.pdf ''United States v.

On August 27, 2008, after three hours of deliberation, the jury recommended the death penalty, and the judge imposed three death sentences for "kidnapping resulting in death, sexual exploitation of a child resulting in death, and use of a firearm in a violent crime resulting in death," all related to the death of Dylan Groene.&lt;ref name=S-Rsentenced2die&gt;{{cite news|last=Russell|first=Betsy Z.|title=Joseph Duncan sentenced to die|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/sections/duncan/?ID=258599|accessdate=March 30, 2011|newspaper=The Spokesman-Review|date=August 28, 2008|author2=Cuniff, Meghann|location=Spokane, Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 3, 2008, Duncan was sentenced to an additional three consecutive terms of life without parole in federal prison for kidnapping Shasta Groene and for sexually abusing Shasta and Dylan.&lt;ref name=FNN_6Life /&gt;

Duncan's standby counsel filed a notice of appeal. Duncan subsequently wrote the court and informed it that any appeal was taken "against his wishes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2011/07/11/08-99031.pdf ''United States v.

In July 2011, the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] reversed the district court's decision to permit Duncan to represent himself without first holding a hearing as to his competence to do so and remanded for a hearing as to this issue.&lt;ref name="ca9.uscourts" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cole | first = David | title = Duncan's sentence questioned | work = [[Bonner County Daily Bee]]| publisher = Hagadone News Network | location=Sandpoint, Idaho|date = July 12, 2011 | url = http://www.bonnercountydailybee.com/news/local/article_cbcf5288-ac50-11e0-9115-001cc4c002e0.html | accessdate = September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2012, Duncan is incarcerated at the [[United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute]] in Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc Inmate Locator], [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]: Joseph Edward Duncan #12561-023. Retrieved on March 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 6, 2013, a federal judge ruled that Duncan was mentally competent when he gave up the right to appeal his death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2013/dec/06/judges-ruling-clears-way-joseph-duncans-execution/] [[The Spokesman-Review]] Retrieved on June 24, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrists working with the prosecution diagnosed Duncan with [[pedophilia]], [[sadistic personality disorder]] and [[antisocial personality disorder]] with [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] traits, but maintained that he was legally sane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Betsy Z.|last=Russell|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2013/dec/07/serial-killer-joseph-duncan-is-mentally-competent/|title=Serial killer Joseph Duncan is mentally competent, federal judge rules|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|location=Spokane, Washington|date=December 7, 2013|accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled on March 27, 2015, that a district judge correctly determined Duncan was mentally competent when he waived his right to appeal his death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Russell | first = Betsy | title = Judge rejects Joseph Duncan's death penalty appeal | work = Spokesman .com | publisher = The Spokesman-Review | date = March 28, 2015 | url = http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/mar/28/judge-rejects-joseph-duncans-death-penalty-appeal/ | accessdate = June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court on February 28, 2016, denied Duncan's petition to hear his appeal of a federal judge's ruling in December 2013, which had been affirmed by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Maben | first = Scott | title = Supreme Court denies Duncan appeal in 2005 kidnapping, murder of Dylan Groene | work = [[The Spokesman-Review]] | publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|location=Spokane, Washington|date = March 2, 2016 | url = http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/mar/02/supreme-court-denies-duncan-appeal-in-2005-murders/ | accessdate = June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2017, a Petition for Writ of [[Habeas Corpus]] was filed.

===California===
On January 18, 2007, the same day Duncan was indicted in federal court, Riverside County officials announced that Duncan was charged with Martinez's murder.&lt;ref name=S-RFedArraign /&gt; Despite attempts by Riverside County officials to extradite Duncan to California, including an appeal by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], Duncan's federal trial proceeded. He was eventually extradited to California on January 24, 2009, five months after being sentenced to death by the federal court.&lt;ref name=KBOI&gt;{{cite web|title=Child killer, Joseph Duncan, extradited to California|url=http://www.kboi2.com/news/38229574.html|publisher=KBOI|accessdate=March 30, 2011|location=Boise, Idaho|date=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2011, Duncan pleaded guilty to Martinez's murder, and was sentenced to two life terms on April 5, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2011/04/05/25635/man-gets-life-prison-california-killing/ |title=Joseph Duncan gets life in prison for California killing |work=KPCC |first=Cheryl |last=Devall |date=April 5, 2011 |accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a plea deal, the sentence comes without the possibility of parole or right to appeal.&lt;ref name=KOMO_20110315 /&gt;&lt;ref name=KABC_20110315&gt;{{cite web|last=McMillan|first=Rob|title=Cold case plea deal brings IE family justice|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/inland_empire&amp;id=8015571|publisher=KABC-TV|accessdate=March 16, 2011|location=Los Angeles|date=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Duncan could have faced a separate death sentence in addition to the ones he had already been sentenced to in federal court, Riverside County District Attorney Paul Zellerbach justified the life sentence by stating that he had consulted with the Martinez family who wanted closure in the case and that "the federal system will kill him long before the state of California would have seriously considered it."&lt;ref name=KOMO_20110315 /&gt;

=="The Fifth Nail" and "Fifth Nail Revelations"==

Prior to his arrest for murder, Duncan maintained a personal website, entitled "The Fifth Nail".&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;{{cite web

Duncan adopted the name for his own website and blog. The website depicted Duncan's day-to-day life as a sex offender. In the [[blog]], he denied being a [[pedophilia|pedophile]], and claimed to have been sexually abused as a child.&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;

Currently, Duncan maintains a blogspot website titled "Joseph E. Duncan III returns to the web from Federal death row to expose the meaning of the Fifth Nail"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://5nintroductions.blogspot.com/|title=The Fifth Nail Exposed: Introductions|website=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the introduction. His most recent contributions are under "The Fifth Nail Exposed: Confessions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://5nconfessions.blogspot.com/|title=The Fifth Nail Exposed: Confessions|website=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt;. All the content on the site is posted by someone called Silenced, who presumably receives letters from Duncan to post on the site on his behalf.

John Adams (Kootenai County public defender) and prosecutor Bill Douglas declined to comment on the possibility that Duncan is blogging from prison. Inmates don't have access to Internet, and while outgoing letters are scanned for requests for contraband or for help in planning an escape, they aren't read word for word&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2006/jan/25/duncan-may-be-getting-blog-out/|title=Duncan may be getting blog out|date=25 Jan 2006|website=The Spokesman-Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Aftermath ==
The jurors who imposed the death penalty on Joseph Duncan were offered counseling&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2008/aug/29/duncan-jurors-offered-counseling/|title=Duncan jurors offered counseling|date=29 Aug 2008|website=The Spokesman-Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order for them to cope with the horrific evidence they had to see during the trial. This evidence included human remains, a wire noose as well as videos of Duncan torturing 9-year-old Dylan Groene. During one of the videos, a child could be heard screaming in pain while a naked Duncan can be heard shouting "The devil is here, boy, the devil himself … The devil likes to watch children suffer and cry!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2008/aug/22/jury-sees-abuse-videos/|title=Jury sees abuse videos|last=|first=|date=22 Aug 2008|work=The Spokesman-Review|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Shasta's home ===

On April 3, 2007, the community effort to build a house for Shasta reached a milestone with more than 50 people attending the groundbreaking ceremony at the site of Shasta Groene's future home. Midge Smock, owner and Foundation Board member of Windermere Coeur d'Alene Reality told attendees that the project was on phase two and that they still had to pay for the lot. Supporters raised about $50,000 and needed to raise another $85,000 to cover the cost of the lot, property taxes and building permits. The house was to be held in a trust for Shasta until she turned 25.

Fundraising efforts began after Shasta's father, Steve Groene apparently told Smock that he and Shasta were homeless. This is a statement that Steve Groene later said he resented because he and Shasta had actually been renting at the time&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/aug/26/steve-groene-father-of-kidnapping-victim-shasta-gr/|title=Steve Groene, father of kidnapping victim Shasta Groene, fighting eviction from Coeur d'Alene home|date=27 Aug 2018|website=The Spokesman-Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fundraising efforts such as a car wash as well as a dinner and auction called Shasta Fiesta was held&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2007/apr/04/shastas-home-under-way/|title=Shasta's home under way|date=4 April 2007|website=The Spokesman-Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Legal troubles ===

Shasta Groene grew to have a troubled history with law enforcement. In February 2014, Shasta was arrested and sent to juvenile detention for 12 months following a drug-related crime. She stated that the sentence saved her life,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.khq.com/story/30388788/shastas-story-shasta-groenes-new-path-10-years-after-tragedy|title=Shasta's Story: Shasta Groene's new path 10 years after tragedy|date=30 Oct 2015|website=KHQ Q6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in October 2017 she was accused of leaving methamphetamine where a 1-year-old could have access to it. In December 2017, she was charged with two misdemeanor charges to which she pleaded guilty in April 2018 and handed an 18-month unsupervised probation with withheld judgement. Upon successful completion of her probation, Shasta could petition to get the charges wiped from her record. A month into her probation however, she violated her probation and admitted the violation on June 21. Her probation sentence remained at 18 months, but it was changed to supervised probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idahopress.com/news/local/shasta-groene-violates-probation-for-endangering-child/article_7b583fdf-4a65-5e39-a982-f0d1a42a85d9.html|title=Shasta Groene violates probation for endangering child|date=25 June 2018|website=Idaho Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Petition for Slade and Dylan's law ===

In 2016, Shasta Groene (then 19 years old) started a petition called Slade and Dylan's law for her two brothers that were murdered by Duncan&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. In the petition description, she stated that convicted sex offenders not be let out of jail. This would effectively mean that the three strike rule for violent sex offenders be reduced to 1 strike. By the time the petition closed, it had 51,820 supporters.

=== Eviction ===
On September 30, 2018, Shasta's father Steve Groene posted on the [https://www.facebook.com/National-One-Strike-Law-for-Slade-and-Dylan-Groene-184880498225618/ National "One Strike" Law for Slade and Dylan Groene]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/National-One-Strike-Law-for-Slade-and-Dylan-Groene-184880498225618/|title=National "One Strike" Law for Slade and Dylan Groene|website=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook page. In this post he stated that he and Shasta were being evicted from the house that was built for him and Shasta. According to him, Shasta tried convincing the trustees (Shasta Groene Charitable Trust&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) to call off the eviction but was unsuccessful in doing so. 

Shasta, now 21, was living in the Boise area and her father Steve was served an eviction notice. The managers of the trust stated that their obligation is to Shasta and not to her father. Ownership of the house is to revert to Shasta on her 25th birthday when the trust expires, unless the trust sells the property before then. One of the trustees, Midge Smock stated that the trust needs to sell the house in order to continue supporting Shasta while she lives in [[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], near Boise.

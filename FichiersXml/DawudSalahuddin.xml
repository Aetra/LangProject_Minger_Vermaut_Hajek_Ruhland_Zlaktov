Salahuddin is the last person known to have seen [[Robert Levinson]], an FBI agent who has been missing since 2007.&lt;ref name=20160116WP&gt;{{cite web|title=2 Americans believed detained in Iran are not among those coming home|publisher=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/2-americans-believed-detained-in-iran-are-not-among-those-coming-home/2016/01/16/1242d488-bc73-11e5-99f3-184bc379b12d_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Dawud Salahuddin was born '''David Theodore Belfield''' in [[Roanoke Rapids, NC|Roanoke Rapids]], [[North Carolina]], on November 10, 1950, and grew up in [[Bay Shore, New York|Bay Shore]], [[New York state|New York]], on [[Long Island]], in a church-going [[Baptist]] family of four boys and one girl.&lt;ref name=NewYorker020805/&gt;

According to Salahuddin, as an African-American child the "most damage done" to him was the feeling he had that it was "an indecency, an insufficiency, certainly a shame not to be white". In 1963 he describes himself as having become politicized while watching news footage from [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]], showing commissioner of public safety [[Bull Connor]] turn back civil-rights marchers with fire hoses and dogs, which caused him to develop "an implacable hatred toward all symbols of American authority". After graduating from high school, he attended [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], for one semester.

He joined a military type group, but eventually left because it opposed his interest in [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name="Trento2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trento|first1=Joseph|title=Prelude to Terror: Edwin P. Wilson and the Legacy of America's Private Intelligence Network|date=March 22, 2006|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0786717668|pages=[https://archive.org/details/preludetoterrorr00tren/page/183 183]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/preludetoterrorr00tren/page/183}}&lt;/ref&gt; He met a musician and a Korean War deserter who convinced him that "Islam was the way for black men to find their destiny."&lt;ref name="Trento2006"/&gt; He met most of the militant Islamic leaders in the U.S. and became more radicalized. He found himself at odds with the Chicago version of Islam taught by [[Elijah Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Trento2006"/&gt; He changed his name to Dawud Salahuddin at this time and began to visit Ernest XX MxGee who had changed his name to [[Hamaas Abdul Khaalis]].&lt;ref name="Trento2006"/&gt; Salahuddin frequented Khaalis' [[7700 16th Street NW|mosque]]. In 1973, when [[1973 Hanafi Muslim massacre|Khaalis' family was murdered]] Salahuddin had "a moment of clarity" and realized, "that the black Islamic leadership in America was being run by, like, the [[Mafia]]".&lt;ref name="Trento2006"/&gt;

He was attracted to [[Islam]] because he thought it was "color-blind," and he converted at the age of 18. He frequented an Iranian student center run by [[Bahram Nahidian]]. During the early 1970s he spent time visiting prisons around Washington, D.C., to "bring the message of Islam to black inmates." He met [[Said Ramadan]], an Egyptian lawyer and Islamic scholar, in 1975, and Ramadan later became his mentor. An article in the [[The New Yorker|''New Yorker'']] quotes him stating that as an "angry and alienated" African-American, "my biggest aspiration was to bring America to its knees, but I didn't know how".&lt;ref name=NewYorker020805/&gt;

Salahuddin first worked for the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] in 1980, shortly after the [[Islamic revolution of Iran|Islamic Revolution]] as a security guard at an Iranian diplomatic office in Washington.&lt;ref name=rmackey&gt;{{cite news|last=Mackey|first=Robert|title=Just Another American Hit Man, Actor and Journalist Living in Iran|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/just-another-american-hit-man-actor-and-journalist-living-in-iran/|accessdate=17 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted an assignment from the Islamic government to assassinate [[Ali Akbar Tabatabai]], a former member of the Shah's regime living in exile in [[Bethesda, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="hitman"/&gt;

According to a 2002 article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, Salahuddin first attempted to convince his Iranian employers to let him kill a more prominent American target, such as [[Henry Kissinger]] or [[Kermit Roosevelt Jr.]]â€”the grandson of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] who orchestrated the 1953 plot to depose Iran's elected prime minister [[Mohammad Mosaddeq]]. But Ali Akbar Tabatabai, an Iranian exile, had been holding meetings of a counter-revolutionary group at his home in Bethesda, and the Islamic government wanted him eliminated.&lt;ref name="hitman"/&gt;

On July 22, 1980, Salahuddin showed up at Tabatabai's front door in Bethesda, Maryland, dressed as a mailman, telling Tabatabai's associate he had a special delivery package that required his signature. When Tabatabai appeared, Salahuddin shot him three times in the abdomen and fled. Tabatabai died 45 minutes later. Salahuddin made his way to Iran by way of Canada and Switzerland.&lt;ref name=NewYorker020805/&gt;&lt;ref name="hitman"/&gt;

===In Iran===
Salahuddin arrived in Iran July 31, 1980, and has lived there most of the time with short periods in other Muslim countries and [[North Korea]], being careful not to expose himself to [[extradition]] back to the United States for homicide.&lt;ref name=NewYorker020805/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cbc060426&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/04/26/lafond-film.html Lafond's new film hits hot buttons], ''[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'', April 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In his over thirty years as a fugitive he has worked as an English teacher, a war correspondent, and a Web editor, fought the Soviets alongside the [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen|Afghan Mujahideen]], and acted "in a film by one of Iran's leading directors" in 2000.&lt;ref name="hitman"/&gt; He married an Iranian woman, speaks [[Persian language|Persian]], and works as a freelance writer. He denies receiving any direct payments from the Iranian government aside from the $5,000 he received for killing Tabatabai.&lt;ref name=NewYorker020805/&gt;

In 1995 Salahuddin admitted to killing Tabatabai in an interview on ABC's [[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]] in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jan/10/features.fiachragibbons Actor or assassin? by Fiachra Gibbons] ''The Guardian'', 10 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In conversations with a reporter from ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine he denied the killing was "murderous", stating it was "an act of war...In [[Islam]]ic religious terms, taking a life is sometimes sanctioned and even highly praised, and I thought that event was just such a time."&lt;ref name=NewYorker020805/&gt;

According to the [[BBC]], Salahuddin is known "by several other names", and U.S. magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported "he is also known as Hassan Abdul Rahman, a former editor of the state-sponsored English-language newspaper ''Iran Daily''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1734315.stm  Kandahar film's murder mystery] 30 December 2001&lt;/ref&gt; According to Salahuddin he was a soldier with the Mujahideen in [[Afghanistan]] from December 1986 to May 1988.&lt;ref name=NewYorker020805/&gt;

Salahuddin worked as chief online editor for [[Press TV]], an English-language international television channel funded by the Iranian government, for three years before resigning in July 2009 following the [[2009 Iranian election protests|disputed]] [[2009 Iranian presidential election|presidential elections]]. He is "close" to prominent Iranian [[Iranian reform movement|reformist]]s film director [[Mohsen Makhmalbaf]] and [[Masoumeh Ebtekar]], the former spokeswoman for the [[Iran hostage crisis|hostage-takers]] at the United States Embassy in Tehran.&lt;ref name="hitman"/&gt;

Salahuddin has had some indirect contact with American authorities. Shortly after the first bombing of the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|World Trade Center in 1993]], U.S. intelligence agents established contact with Salahuddin, who "began a back-channel relationship with American authorities and talked about returning to the United States to stand trial in the murder of Tabatabai". He sent a letter to [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]] dated March 5, 1994, proposing mediating between the United States and "certain key figures in the worldwide Islamic movement" in return for freedom from prosecution. No reply was given to his letter.&lt;ref name=NewYorker020805/&gt;

Salahuddin reportedly met with [[Robert Levinson]] on Iran's [[Kish Island]] in 2007 shortly before Levinson disappeared while Levinson was working on a botched CIA operation.&lt;ref name=20160116WP /&gt;&lt;ref name="20170428TOI"&gt;{{cite news|title=US pushes for release of Americans in direct talks with Iran|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-pushes-for-release-of-americans-in-direct-talks-with-iran/|accessdate=29 April 2017|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 25, 2020 Levinson's family reported that US officials had informed them that Levinson died in Iranian custody.

===Film appearances===
Salahuddin plays a sympathetic major character who aided the heroine of the 2001 film ''[[Kandahar (2001 film)|Kandahar]]'' by director [[Mohsen Makhmalbaf]]. The heroine of the film is a [[Canada|Canadian]] woman, born in [[Afghanistan]], who slips back into Afghanistan, before the fall of the [[Taliban]] in order to try to rescue her sister. During her travels she is befriended by an English-speaking medic (Salahuddin) who turns out to be an exiled American political activist. The heroine of the film really did travel to Afghanistan, in an attempt to rescue her friend, and Salahuddin is an American in exile for a "political activity".

In response to criticism of his casting of Salahuddin, Makhmalbaf wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that he (Makhmalbaf), had been tortured by the [[SAVAK]], of which the murder victim Tabatabai was "a prominent member", and that Tabatabai's brother "does not understand that Belfield [Salahuddin] is also a victimâ€”a victim of the ideal he believed in. His humanity, when he opened fire against his ideological enemy, was martyred by his idealism".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jan/11/artsfeatures The condemned] 11 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

After the film was released, [[Doug Gansler]], then State's Attorney for [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], later [[Attorney General of Maryland]], said that Salahuddin was still a wanted man.&lt;ref name="Michael Taylor 2002"/&gt;

In 2006 [[Jean-Daniel Lafond]] released a film entitled ''[[American Fugitive: The Truth About Hassan]]'', about Salahuddin. Lafond's film stirred controversy. Some reviewers called it "convincing, gripping, moving",&lt;ref name=InformAction/&gt; while others thought it gave "credence to conspiracy theories debunked years ago" and sympathy for "a cold-blooded murderer".&lt;ref name=NatPost060502&gt;[http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/issuesideas/story.html?id=3013aac0-8f41-4fdf-b890-5c1569da7056 Airbrushing a killer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210105103/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/issuesideas/story.html?id=3013aac0-8f41-4fdf-b890-5c1569da7056 |date=2009-12-10 }}, ''[[National Post]]'', May 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

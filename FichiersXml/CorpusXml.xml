'''Amelia Elizabeth Dyer''' (née '''Hobley'''; 1836 – 10 June 1896) was one of the most prolific [[serial killer]]s in history, [[murder]]ing infants in her care over a 30-year period in [[Victorian era|Victorian Britain]].&lt;ref name="tragedy"&gt;[http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/babyfarm.html "'Baby Farming' – a tragedy of Victorian times."]. Retrieved 2008-10-28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alison/&gt; Trained as a nurse, and widowed in 1869, she turned to [[baby farming]]—the practice of adopting unwanted infants in exchange for money—to support herself. She initially cared for the children legitimately, in addition to having two of her own, but whether intentionally or not, a number of them died in her care, leading to a conviction for negligence and six months' hard labour. She then began directly murdering children she "adopted", strangling at least some of them, and disposing of the bodies to avoid attention. Mentally unstable, she was committed to several [[mental asylum]]s throughout her life, despite suspicions of [[feigning]], and survived at least one serious suicide attempt.

Dyer's downfall came when the bagged corpse of an infant was discovered in the [[Thames]], with evidence leading to her. She was arrested on 4 April 1896, tried for the murder of infant Doris Marmon, and hanged on 10 June 1896. At the time of her death, a handful of murders were attributed to her, but there is little doubt she was responsible for many more similar deaths—possibly 400 or more.&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thames Valley Police Museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Baby Farmer|url=http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/aboutus-museum-baby-farmer|publisher=Thames Valley Police|accessdate=17 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302213715/http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/aboutus-museum-baby-farmer|archivedate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-39330793|title=Amelia Dyer: The Victorian nurse who strangled babies|date=3 June 2017|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubbed the "Ogress of Reading", she inspired a popular ballad, and her case led to stricter laws for adoption.

==Background==
Amelia Dyer was born the youngest of five (with three brothers, Thomas, James and William, and a sister, Ann) in the small village of Pyle Marsh,&lt;ref name=alison&gt;Vale, Allison; Alison Rattle (2007). ''Amelia Dyer: Angel Maker'', {{ISBN|978-0-233-00224-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; just east of [[Bristol]] (now part of Bristol's [[urban sprawl]] known as Pile Marsh), the daughter of a master [[shoemaker]], Samuel Hobley, and Sarah Hobley née Weymouth. She learned to read and write and developed a love of literature and poetry.&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-484575/The-baby-butcher-One-Victorian-Britains-evil-murderers-exposed.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |title=The baby butcher: One of Victorian Britain's most evil murderers exposed |accessdate=2008-10-21 | date=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, her childhood was marred by the mental illness of her mother, caused by [[typhus]]. Amelia witnessed her mother's violent fits and was obliged to care for her until she died, raving, in 1848. Researchers later commented on the effect this had on Dyer, and also what it taught her about the symptoms exhibited by those who appear to lose their mind through illness.&lt;ref name="cole"&gt;''The Lady Killers'' (1998). Amelia Dyer, ITV series. Hosted by Martina Cole. Broadcast 2010-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyer had an elder sister, Sarah Ann who died in 1841, aged 6 and a younger sister also named Sarah Ann who died in 1845, aged a few months. An elder cousin had an illegitimate daughter at the time who was later accepted as the daughter of the grandparents, Dyer's aunt and uncle William and Martha Hobley.

After her mother's death Amelia lived with an aunt in Bristol for a while, before serving an apprenticeship with a corset maker. Her father died in 1859. Her eldest brother, Thomas, inherited the family shoe business. In 1861, at the age of 24, Amelia became permanently estranged from at least one of her brothers, James, and moved into lodgings in Trinity Street, Bristol.&lt;ref name=alison/&gt; There she married George Thomas. George was 59 and they both lied about their ages on the marriage certificate to reduce the age gap. George deducted 11 years from his age and Amelia added 6 years to her age&lt;ref name=alison/&gt;—many sources later reported this age as fact, causing much confusion.

==Nursing==
After marrying George Thomas, Dyer trained as a [[nurse]]. From contact with a [[midwife]], Ellen Dane, she learned of an easier way to earn a living—using her own home to provide lodgings for young women who had conceived [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimately]] and then farming off the babies for adoption or allowing them to die of neglect and malnutrition. (Ellen Dane was forced to decamp to the US, shortly after meeting Amelia, to escape the attention of the authorities.)&lt;ref name=alison/&gt; Unmarried mothers in Victorian Britain often struggled to gain an income, since the 1834 [[Poor Law Amendment Act]] had removed any financial obligation from the fathers of illegitimate children, whilst bringing up their children in a society where single parenthood and illegitimacy were stigmatized. This led to the practice of [[baby farming]] in which individuals acted as [[adoption]] or [[foster care|fostering]] agents, in return for regular payments or a single, up-front fee from the babies' mothers. Many businesses were set up to take in these young women and care for them until they gave birth. The mothers subsequently left their unwanted babies to be looked after as "nurse children".&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher/&gt;

The predicament of the parents involved was often exploited for financial gain: if a baby had well-off parents who were simply anxious to keep the birth secret, the single fee might be as much as £80. Fifty pounds might be negotiated if the father of the child wanted to hush up his involvement. However, it was more common for these expectant young women to be impoverished. Such women would be charged about £5.&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher/&gt;

Unscrupulous carers resorted to [[Starvation|starving]] the farmed-out babies, to save money and even to hasten death. Noisy or demanding babies could be sedated with easily available alcohol and/or [[opiate]]s. [[Godfrey's Cordial]]—known colloquially as "Mother's Friend", (a syrup containing [[opium]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/45/6/1011 "What Were Godfrey's Cordial And Dalby's Carminative?, ''Pediatrics''.] Retrieved 2008-10-23&lt;/ref&gt;—was a frequent choice, but there were several other similar preparations.&lt;ref name="opium"/&gt; Many children died as a result of such dubious practices: "Opium killed far more infants through starvation than directly through [[Drug overdose|overdose]]." Dr. Greenhow, investigating for the [[Privy council|Privy Council]], noted how children "kept in a state of continued [[Unconsciousness|narcotism]] will be thereby disinclined for food, and be but imperfectly nourished." Death from severe [[malnutrition]] would result, but the [[coroner]] was likely to record the death as {{"'}}debility from birth,' or 'lack of breast milk,' or simply 'starvation. {{'"}}&lt;ref name="opium"&gt;Quoted in: [http://www.victorianweb.org/science/health/health4.html ''Opium and Infant Mortality''] Retrieved 2008-10-24, sourced from Wohl, Anthony S. ''Endangered Lives: Public Health in Victorian Britain.'' Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1983. pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers who chose to reclaim or simply check on the welfare of their children could often encounter difficulties, but some would simply be too frightened or ashamed to tell the police about any suspected wrongdoing. Even the authorities often had problems tracing any children that were reported missing.&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher/&gt;

This was the world opened up to her by the now-departed Ellen Dane. Dyer had to leave nursing with the birth of a daughter, Ellen Thomas. In 1869 the elderly George Thomas died and Amelia needed an income.&lt;ref name=alison/&gt;

==Murders==
Dyer was keen to make money from baby farming, and alongside taking in expectant women, she advertised to [[breastfeeding|nurse]] and adopt a baby, in return for a substantial one-off payment and adequate clothing for the child. In her advertisements and meetings with clients, she assured them that she was respectable and married and that she would provide a safe and loving home for the child.&lt;ref name=" Thames Valley Police Museum"/&gt;

In 1872, Amelia married William Dyer, a brewer's laborer from Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;Register of Marriages for Bristol Registration District, Volume 6a (1872) p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children together: Mary Ann, also known as Polly, and William Samuel. Amelia eventually left her husband.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hobley-10&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point in her baby farming career, Dyer decided to forgo the expense and inconvenience of letting the children die through neglect and starvation; soon after the receipt of each child, she murdered them, thus allowing her to pocket most or all of the fee.&lt;ref name=" Thames Valley Police Museum"/&gt;

For some time, Dyer eluded the resulting interest of the police. She was eventually caught in 1879 after a doctor was suspicious about the number of child deaths he had been called to certify in Dyer's care. However, instead of being convicted of murder or [[manslaughter]], she was sentenced to six months' hard labor for [[Neglect (English law)|neglect]]. The experience allegedly almost destroyed her mentally,&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher/&gt; though others have expressed incredulity at the leniency of the sentence when compared to those handed out for lesser crimes at that time.

Upon release, she attempted to resume her nursing career. She had spells in [[mental hospital]]s due to her alleged mental instability and suicidal tendencies;&lt;ref name="Rose, Lionel 1986 p.160"&gt;Rose, Lionel (1986). ''The Massacre of the Innocents'', Routledge, p.160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Lionel (1986). ''The Massacre of the Innocents'', Routledge. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sZc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP7] Retrieved 2008-10-24&lt;/ref&gt; these always coincided with times when it was convenient for her to "disappear". Being a former asylum nurse Dyer knew how to behave to ensure a relatively comfortable existence as an asylum inmate.&lt;ref name=alison/&gt; Dyer appears to have begun abusing alcohol and opium-based products early in her killing career; her mental instability could have been related to her substance abuse. In 1890, Dyer cared for the illegitimate baby of a governess. When she returned to visit the child, the governess was immediately suspicious and stripped the baby to see if a birthmark was present on one of its hips. It wasn't, and prolonged suspicions by the authorities led to Dyer having or feigning, a breakdown. Dyer at one point drank two bottles of [[laudanum]] in a serious suicide attempt, but her long-term abuse had built up her tolerance to opium products, so she survived.

She returned to baby farming and murder. Dyer realized the folly of involving doctors to issue [[death certificate]]s and began disposing of the bodies herself. The precarious nature and extent of her activities again prompted undesirable attention; she was alert to the attention of police—and of parents seeking to reclaim their children. She and her family frequently relocated to different towns and cities to escape suspicion, regain anonymity—and to acquire new business. Over the years, Dyer used a succession of aliases.&lt;ref name="Thames Valley Police Museum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rose, Lionel 1986 p.160"/&gt;

In 1893, Dyer was discharged from her final committal at the [[Mendip Hospital|Somerset and Bath Lunatic Asylum]] near Wells.&lt;ref name="Rose, Lionel 1986 p.160"/&gt; Unlike previous "breakdowns" this had been a most disagreeable experience, and she never entered another asylum.&lt;ref name=alison/&gt; Two years later, Dyer moved to [[Caversham, Reading|Caversham]], Berkshire, accompanied by an unsuspecting associate, Jane "Granny" Smith, whom Dyer had recruited from a brief spell in a workhouse and Dyer's daughter and son-in-law, Mary Ann (known as Polly) and Arthur Palmer. This was followed by a move to 45 Kensington Road, [[Reading, Berkshire]] later the same year.&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher/&gt; Smith was persuaded by Dyer to be referred to as 'mother' in front of innocent women handing over their children. This was an effort to present a caring mother-daughter image.

===Case study: the murder of Doris Marmon===
In January 1896, Evelina Marmon, a popular 25-year-old barmaid, gave birth to an illegitimate daughter, Doris, in a boarding house in [[Cheltenham]]. She quickly sought offers of adoption and placed an advertisement in the "Miscellaneous" section of the ''Bristol Times &amp; Mirror'' newspaper. It simply read: "Wanted, respectable woman to take a young child." Marmon intended to go back to work and hoped to eventually reclaim her child.&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher/&gt;

Coincidentally, next to her own, was an advertisement reading: "Married couple with no family would adopt a healthy child, nice country home. Terms, £10". Marmon responded, to a "Mrs. Harding", and a few days later she received a reply from Dyer. From Oxford Road in Reading, "Mrs. Harding" wrote that "I should be glad to have a dear baby girl, one I could bring up and call my own." She continued: "We are plain, homely people, in fairly good circumstances. I don't want a child for money's sake, but the company and home comfort&amp;nbsp;... I and my husband are dearly fond of children. I have no child of my own. A child with me will have a good home and a mother's love".&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher/&gt;

Evelina Marmon wanted to pay a more affordable, weekly fee for the care of her daughter, but "Mrs. Harding" insisted on being given the one-off payment in advance. Marmon was in dire straits, so she reluctantly agreed to pay the £10, and a week later "Mrs. Harding" arrived in Cheltenham.&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher/&gt;

Marmon was surprised by Dyer's advanced age and stocky appearance, but as Dyer was affectionate towards Doris, Evelina handed over her daughter, a cardboard box of clothes and £10. Still distressed at having to give up care for her daughter, Evelina accompanied Dyer to Cheltenham station, and then on to [[Gloucester]]. She returned to her lodgings "a broken woman". A few days later, she received a letter from "Mrs. Harding" saying all was well; Marmon wrote back, but received no reply.&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher/&gt;

Dyer did not travel to Reading, as she had told Marmon. She went instead to 76 Mayo Road, [[Willesden]], London where her 23-year-old daughter Polly was staying. There, Dyer quickly found some white edging tape used in [[Dressmaker|dressmaking]], wound it twice around the baby's neck and tied a knot. Death would not have been immediate.&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher/&gt; Dyer later said: "I used to like to watch them with the tape around their neck, but it was soon all over with them."&lt;ref name=alison/&gt;

Both women allegedly helped to wrap the body in a napkin. They kept some of the clothes Marmon had packed; the rest was destined for the [[pawnbroker]]. Dyer paid the rent to the unwitting landlady and gave her a pair of child's boots as a present for her little girl. The following day, Wednesday 1 April 1896, another child, named Harry Simmons, was taken to Mayo Road. However, with no spare white edging tape available, the length around Doris's corpse was removed and used to strangle the 13-month-old boy.&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher/&gt;

On 2 April, both bodies were stacked into a [[carpet bag]], along with bricks for added weight. Dyer then headed for Reading. At a secluded spot, she knew well near a weir at [[Caversham Lock]], she forced the carpetbag through railings into the [[River Thames]].&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher/&gt;

==Dyer's downfall==

===Discovery of corpses===
Unbeknownst to Dyer, on 30 March 1896, a package was retrieved from the Thames at Reading by a [[barge]]man. The package Dyer dumped was not weighted adequately and had been easily spotted. It contained the body of a baby girl, later identified as Helena Fry. In the small detective force available to [[Reading Borough Police]], Detective [[Constable]] Anderson made a crucial breakthrough. As well as finding a label from [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Temple Meads station]], Bristol, he used microscopic analysis of the wrapping paper and deciphered a faintly legible name—Mrs. Thomas—and an address.&lt;ref name=" Thames Valley Police Museum"/&gt;

This evidence was enough to lead police to Dyer, but they still had no strong evidence to connect her directly with a serious crime. Additional evidence they gleaned from witnesses, and information obtained from Bristol police, only served to increase their concerns, and D.C. Anderson, with [[Sgt.]] James placed Dyer's home under surveillance. Subsequent intelligence suggested that Dyer would abscond if she came at all under suspicion. The officers decided to use a young woman as a decoy, hoping she would be able to secure a meeting with Dyer to discuss her services. This may have been designed to help the detectives to positively link Dyer to her business activities, or it may have simply given them a reliable opportunity to arrest her.&lt;ref name=" Thames Valley Police Museum"/&gt;

It transpired that Dyer was expecting her new client (the decoy) to call, but instead, she found detectives waiting on her doorstep. On 3 April (Good Friday), the police raided her home. They were struck by the stench of human decomposition, although no human remains were found. There was, however, plenty of other related evidence, including white edging tape, [[telegram]]s regarding adoption arrangements, [[pawn ticket]]s for children's clothing, receipts for advertisements and letters from mothers inquiring about the well-being of their children.&lt;ref name=" Thames Valley Police Museum"/&gt;

The police calculated that in the previous few months alone, at least twenty children had been placed in the care of a "Mrs. Thomas", now revealed to be Amelia Dyer. It also appeared that she was about to move home again, this time to [[Somerset]].&lt;ref name="Thebabybutcher"/&gt; This rate of murder has led to some estimates that Mrs. Dyer may, over decades, have killed over 400 babies and children, making her one of the most prolific murderers ever.&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt;

Dyer was arrested on 4 April and charged with murder. Her son-in-law Arthur Palmer was charged as an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]]. During April, the Thames was dredged and six more bodies were discovered, including Doris Marmon and Harry Simmons—Dyer's last victims. Each baby had been strangled with white tape, which as she later told the police "was how you could tell it was one of mine".&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher/&gt;
Eleven days after handing her daughter to Dyer, Evelina Marmon, whose name had emerged in items kept by Dyer, identified her daughter's remains.&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher/&gt;

===Inquest and trial===
[[File:amelia-dyer.jpg|320px|thumb|right|Police photo of Dyer after her arrest in 1896]]
At the inquest into the deaths in early May, no evidence was found that Mary Ann or Arthur Palmer had acted as Dyer's accomplices. Arthur Palmer was discharged as the result of a confession written by Amelia Dyer. In Reading Gaol she wrote (with her spelling and punctuation preserved):

{{quote|Sir will you kindly grant me the favor of presenting this to the [[magistrate]]s on Saturday the 18th instant I have made this statement out, for I may not have the opportunity then I must relieve my mind I do know and I feel my days are numbered on this earth but I do feel it is an awful thing drawing innocent people into trouble I do know I should have to answer before my Maker in Heaven for the awful crimes I have committed but as God Almighty is my judge in Heaven an on Hearth neither my daughter Mary Ann Palmer nor her husband Alfred Ernest Palmer I do most solemnly declare neither of them had anything at all to do with it, they never knew I contemplated doing such a wicked thing until it was too late I am speaking the truth and nothing but the truth as I hope to be forgiven, I and I alone must stand before my Maker in Heaven to answer it all witness my hand Amelia Dyer. |April 16, 1896, &lt;ref name=" Thames Valley Police Museum"/&gt;}}

On 22 May 1896, Dyer appeared at the [[Old Bailey]] and pleaded guilty to one murder, that of Doris Marmon. Her family and associates testified at her trial that they had been growing suspicious and uneasy about her activities, and it emerged that Dyer had narrowly escaped discovery on several occasions.&lt;ref name=" Thames Valley Police Museum"/&gt; Evidence from a man who had seen and spoken to Dyer when she had disposed of the two bodies at Caversham Lock also proved significant. Her daughter had given graphic evidence that ensured Dyer's conviction.&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher/&gt;

The only defense Dyer offered was [[insanity defense|insanity]]: she had been twice committed to asylums in Bristol. However, the prosecution argued successfully that her exhibitions of mental instability had been a ploy to avoid suspicion; both committals were said to have coincided with times when Dyer was concerned her crimes might have been exposed.&lt;ref name=" Thames Valley Police Museum"/&gt;

It took the jury only four and a half minutes to find her guilty. In her three weeks in the condemned cell, she filled five exercise books with her "last true and only confession". Visited the night before her execution by the chaplain and asked if she had anything to confess, she offered him her exercise books, saying, "isn't this enough?"&lt;ref name="tragedy"/&gt; Curiously, she was subpoenaed to appear as a witness in Polly's trial for murder, set for a week after her execution date. However, it was ruled that Dyer was already legally dead once sentenced and that therefore her evidence would be inadmissible. Thus, her execution was not delayed. On the eve of her execution, Dyer heard that the charges against Polly had been dropped. Dyer was hanged by [[James Billington (executioner)|James Billington]] at [[Newgate Prison]] on Wednesday, 10 June 1896.&lt;ref name="Rose, Lionel 1986 p.161"&gt;{{cite book | last = Rose | first = Lionel | year = 1986 | title = Massacre of the Innocents: Infanticide in Britain, 1800-1939 | publisher = Routledge | page = 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked on the scaffold if she had anything to say, she said "I have nothing to say", just before being dropped at 9&amp;nbsp;a.m. precisely.

==Later developments==
It is uncertain how many more children Amelia Dyer murdered. However, inquiries from mothers, evidence of other witnesses, and material found in Dyer's homes, including letters and many babies' clothes, pointed to many more.&lt;ref name=" Thames Valley Police Museum"/&gt;

The Dyer case caused a scandal. She became known as the "Ogress of Reading", and she inspired a popular ballad:

{{quote|The old baby farmer, the wretched Miss Dyer&lt;br/&gt;At the Old Bailey her wages is paid.&lt;br/&gt;In times long ago, we'd 'a' made a big fy-er&lt;br/&gt;And roasted so nicely that wicked old jade.&lt;ref name="Rose, Lionel 1986 p.161"/&gt;}}

Adoption laws were subsequently made stricter, giving local authorities the power to police baby farms in the hope of stamping out abuse. Despite this and the scrutinizing of newspaper personal ads,&lt;ref name="Rose, Lionel 1986 p.161"/&gt; the trafficking and abuse of infants did not stop. Two years after Dyer's execution, railway workers inspecting carriages at [[Newton Abbot]], [[Devon]], found a parcel. Inside was a three-week-old girl but, though cold and wet, she was alive. The daughter of a widow, Jane Hill, the baby had been given to Mrs. Stewart, for £12. She had picked up the baby at [[Plymouth]]—and dumped her on the next train. It has been claimed that "Mrs. Stewart" was Polly, the daughter of Amelia Dyer.&lt;ref name=Thebabybutcher/&gt;

The character of Amelia Dyer appeared in the short story "The Baby Farmer" by Philip Fracassi in his horror collection ''Behold the Void''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fracassi |first1=Philip |title=Behold the Void |date=2018 |publisher=Lovecraft eZine Press |isbn=9780578423692 |pages=97–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because she was a murderess alive at the time of the [[Jack the Ripper]] killings, some have suggested that Dyer was Jack the Ripper, who killed the prostitutes through botched abortions.{{Citation needed|reason=This is stated as a known fact, but I cannot turn up conclusive links to botched-abortions-as-Ripper-methodology|date=November 2019}} This suggestion was put forward by author William Stewart, although he preferred [[Mary Pearcey]] as his chosen suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=William |last=Stewart |year=1939 |title=Jack The Ripper: A New Theory |publisher=Quality Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, no evidence to connect Dyer to the Jack the Ripper murders.

'''Bandali Michael Debs''' (born 18 July 1953&lt;ref name="SilkMillersentencing"/&gt;) is an [[Australian]] convicted [[serial killer]] currently serving four consecutive terms of [[life imprisonment]] plus 27 years for the murder of two [[Victoria Police]] officers in August of 1998 and for the 1997 murder of teenager Kristy Harty.&lt;ref name="HartySentencing"/&gt; Debs was detained at [[HM Prison Barwon]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].  On 12 December 2011 he was convicted of the April 1995 shooting murder of New South Wales sex worker Donna Ann Hicks.&lt;ref name="Age" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hicksMurder"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/09/3061726.htm |title=Man charged 15 years after prostitute's murder |date=9 November 2010 |website=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |access-date=26 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is portrayed by Australian actor [[Greg Stone]] in the telemovie ''[[Underbelly Files: Tell Them Lucifer was Here]]''.

==Personal life==
Debs, from [[Narre Warren, Victoria|Narre Warren]], a south eastern suburb of Melbourne was employed as a [[tiler]]. He had fathered five children. His youngest son Joseph was found dead due to a suspected [[drug overdose]] at a house in [[Greensborough, Victoria|Greensborough]] in December 2003.&lt;ref name="youngsondead"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/23/1071941733330.html |title=Debs's youngest son found dead |first1=Chris |last1=Evans |first2=John |last2=Silvester |date=24 December 2003 |newspaper=[[The Age]] |access-date=26 November 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031225055430/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/23/1071941733330.html |archive-date=25 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, 2003, Debs was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment with no minimum term for the murders of two Victoria Police officers, Sergeant Gary Silk and Senior Constable Rodney Miller at [[Moorabbin, Victoria]] on 16 August 1998.&lt;ref name=HartySentencing/&gt;

Accomplice Jason Joseph Roberts, who was 22 at the time of sentencing, was also convicted of the police murders and sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment with a minimum term of 35 years.

==Murder of Kristy Harty==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:KHarty.jpg|right|thumb|Kristy Harty]{{deletable image-caption|Monday, 11 June 2018|PROD}}]] --&gt;
On 20 June 2005, police charged Debs with the murder of troubled teenager Kristy Mary Harty,&lt;ref name="dnalink"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/dna-tests-link-debs-to-prostitute-death/2005/07/20/1121539031258.html |title=DNA tests link Debs to prostitute death |first1=John |last1=Silvester |first2=Stephen |last2=Moynihan |date=21 July 2005 |newspaper=[[Herald Sun]] |access-date=26 November 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050722034456/http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/dna-tests-link-debs-to-prostitute-death/2005/07/20/1121539031258.html |archive-date=22 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was murdered at [[Beaconsfield, Victoria|Upper Beaconsfield]] on 17 June 1997.

Harty was [[soliciting]] for sex along the [[Princes Highway]] when she met with Debs. The pair drove to a secluded bush track in Upper Beaconsfield where they had [[unprotected sex]]. Harty was later murdered. Her semi-naked body was found lying face down by bushwalkers. A single gunshot wound was discovered at the rear of her head.&lt;ref name="noparole"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21913015-2862,00.html |title=No-parole call on Debs |first=Emily |last=Power |date=21 July 2005 |newspaper=Herald Sun |access-date=26 November 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906021947/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21913015-2862,00.html |archive-date=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DNA]] tests revealed [[semen]] located on the body of Harty that was linked to Debs.

In May 2007, Debs was convicted of the murder of Harty and sentenced to a third consecutive term of life imprisonment.&lt;ref name=HartySentencing/&gt;

In sentencing Debs, Justice Kaye remarked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Your murder of Ms Harty was entirely [[senseless violence|senseless]], needless and wanton. The evidence discloses beyond any doubt that this was not a case of a sexual encounter in which, in the heat of the moment, feelings or passions may have led to a spontaneous and irrational act of violence. Rather, and quite to the contrary, this was, most clearly, a callous, craven and senseless murder in cold blood of an entirely innocent, defenceless and vulnerable young woman. The evidence leads to the inevitable conclusion that you murdered Kristy Harty for no other reason than for the sheer sake of it.&lt;ref name=HartySentencing/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Murder of Donna Anne Hicks==

Donna Anne Hicks was shot dead in April 1995 in western [[Sydney]].

Debs was subsequently linked to the case through [[DNA analysis]]. Debs had been entered into a DNA database of criminals. On 30 September 2008, Melbourne detectives interviewed Debs and raided his previous address in Sydney.&lt;ref name="hickscase"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/jailed-killer-debs-linked-to-1995-sydney-murder-20080930-4r87.html |title=Jailed killer Debs linked to 1995 Sydney murder |first=John |last=Silvester |date=1 October 2008 |newspaper=The Age |access-date=26 November 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081104112334/http://www.theage.com.au/national/jailed-killer-debs-linked-to-1995-sydney-murder-20080930-4r87.html |archive-date=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December 2011 he was found guilty of Hicks' murder in the New South Wales Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Age"/&gt; He was sentenced to a fourth consecutive life term for the murder.

==Prison life==
While imprisoned, Debs has undertaken psychology, life skills and computer training and is employed as a prison carpet cleaner.&lt;ref name=noparole/&gt;

'''Campo Elías Delgado Morales''' (14 May 1934 &amp;ndash; 4 December 1986) was a Colombian [[spree killer]] and self-described [[Vietnam War]] [[veteran]] who killed 29 people, and wounded 12 more, most of them at a luxurious [[Bogotá]] restaurant called Pozzetto, before apparently being shot dead by police.

==Personal life==
Delgado, born on 14 May 1934, in [[Chinácota]], [[Colombia]], was the son of Rita Elisa Morales. He had a sister who resented him. In 1941 he saw his father commit suicide and held his mother responsible for this incident his entire life. He was said to have been an excellent student and studied medicine.

A refugee in the streets of [[New York City|New York]], he returned to [[Bogotá]] after a fight with a thief. Delgado then lived by teaching private English lessons and was taking graduate studies at the [[Pontifical Xavierian University|Universidad Javeriana]] in Bogotá. He was no longer able to develop friendships, for which he blamed his mother. As the years went by, he grew more and more resentful of her. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==U.S. Military Service==
According to the [[National Personnel Records Center]], Delgado served with the U.S. Army from August 12, 1975 to August 11, 1978. He was honorably discharged as a [[Sergeant first class]]. According to these dates, it's impossible for him to have fought in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://imgur.com/gallery/zc5Aajh |title=Antecedentes militares DELGADO, Campo E. |last=Washington |first=Ashley |publisher=National Personnel Records Center |date=December 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellow soldier Art Fealey, claims to have met Delgado in the 5th infantry, 3rd battalion while in the Panama Canal Zone in 1975. He said Delgado was later stationed at the Army's medical center in El Paso, Texas until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1986 |title=Local Army Vet Served With Colombian Mass Murderer |work=The Times Leader |location=Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Killing spree==

===Preparation===
On 3 December 1986, around noon, Delgado entered the [[Banco de Bogotá]] to close his bank account and withdraw his entire deposits of $49,896.93. When the cashier handed him a round number of $49,896.50, Delgado insisted on receiving the remaining 43 cents. Either during the afternoon of the same day, or the next morning, Delgado bought a [[.32 S&amp;W Long|.32-caliber]] [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 30|Smith &amp; Wesson Model 31-1]] revolver and 500 rounds of ammunition.&lt;ref name=SEM1&gt;[http://www.semana.com/especiales/articulo/la-masacre/8528-3 La Masacre], ''[[Semana]]'' (January 5, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elperiodicodemonagas.com.ve"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.elperiodicodemonagas.com.ve/site/el-colombiano-que-mato-a-29-personas-e-hirio-15-por-43-centavos-de-dolar/|title=El colombiano que mató a 29 personas e hirió 15 por 43 centavos de dólar|website=elPeriodico|date=4 December 2019|accessdate=4 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apartment buildings===
On 4 December at approximately 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Delgado went to an apartment building at Calle 118 No. 40-11 and entered apartment 304, where Nora Becerra de Rincón lived together with her 14-year-old daughter Claudia Rincón, whom Delgado had given lessons in English, as well as her 11-year-old son Julio Eduardo, her mother, and a friend of the latter. Besides Nora Becerra and her daughter, nobody was at home at that time. Delgado gagged and handcuffed Nora Becerra and fatally stabbed her four times with a hunting knife on the couch in the living room. He also gagged Claudia Rincón, and bound her hands and feet, before stabbing her 22 times and leaving her dead on a bed. The bodies were found the next day by Julio Eduardo.

At 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Delgado was back at the apartment he shared with his mother at Carrera 7, Calle 52. Around 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., after a heated argument with her, he walked up behind Rita Delgado and killed her with a single stab to the back of the neck, afterwards wrapping her body in newspapers, sprinkling it with gasoline, and setting it on fire. Delgado then grabbed his revolver and a briefcase containing five boxes of ammunition and the knife, and ran through the apartment complex screaming "''¡Fuego! ¡Fuego!''" (Fire! Fire!). He went downstairs and rang at apartment 301, where students Inés Gordi Galat and Nelsy Patricia Cortés were living, saying that he needed to call the fire department. As soon as they opened the door, Delgado killed both women with single shots to the head and then proceeded to apartment 302, where he did the same with Gloria Isabel Agudelo León, who had been alarmed by the shooting and opened the door to investigate.

Delgado then headed down to the first floor where he rang at apartment 101, again pretending that he needed to call the fire department. The apartment was occupied by four women, Mrs. Berta Gómez, who saved her life by jumping out into the courtyard, as well as students Matilde Rocío González, Mercedes Gamboa, and María Claudia Bermúdez Durán, who were all shot. González, who had already picked up the telephone receiver, and Gamboa both died at the scene, while Maria Bermúdez died a few hours later in Hospital San José.

Outside the building, Delgado stared a couple of minutes at a poster, advertising a play of ''[[Blood Wedding (play)|Bodas de Sangre]]'' at a local theater. Meanwhile, Mrs. Berta Gómez stopped a police patrol and asked them for help, though, seeing the fire on the fourth floor, the officers responded that this was more a case for the firefighters and therefore did not intervene.

Delgado eventually left for house number 201 at Carrera 28A No. 51-31, where the Castro family was living, with whom he had been friends for five years. He arrived there about 15 minutes later in a rather agitated state. Against his habit of being a man of rather few words, Delgado talked incessantly, repeated sentences several times, and paced through the living room, declining any of Mrs. Castro's invitations to sit down. According to Clemencia de Castro, Delgado told her that he had come to say farewell, as he had bought a one way ticket and would go on a trip to the U.S., or China.

At 6:45&amp;nbsp;p.m., Delgado left the Castros, assuring them that they would soon hear from him, and went to Pizzería Pozzetto, an Italian restaurant in the [[Chapinero]] district where he ate frequently, discarding the hunting knife on his way. By that time police and journalists were searching for the murderer throughout the city.&lt;ref name=SEM1/&gt;

===Restaurant Pozzetto===
Delgado arrived at the restaurant at around 7:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., greeted the waiters and ordered half a bottle of red wine and [[spaghetti]] [[bolognese sauce|bolognese]]. The waiters noticed that during his meal Delgado went to the restroom several times. After finishing his meal Delgado began to read an American magazine, ordered two [[Screwdriver (cocktail)|screwdriver cocktails]], and paid his bill. After drinking a third vodka at around quarter past eight he sat down at the bar to have a fourth.&lt;ref name=SEM1/&gt;

Around 9:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., Delgado opened fire on the diners. Delgado shot a total of 32 people, twenty of them fatally.&lt;ref&gt;[[Instinto Asesino]] - La Masacre de Pozzetto, ''[[Discovery Channel]]''&lt;/ref&gt; His method was to corner his victim and shoot them at [[point-blank]] range in the [[forehead]] and then move on to the next victim. Delgado promised himself not to kill any children, but he accidentally killed a six-year-old girl sitting at an adjacent table when his revolver misfired. When police arrived ten minutes later, Delgado turned his attention to them, holding them off for one minute. He was apparently killed with a shot to the temple by a police officer. There is also a belief that Delgado committed suicide. After some time, police discovered with a comparison of the bullets that Delgado was shot by a police officer while he was reloading.

==In popular culture==
In 2002, Colombian writer [[Mario Mendoza Zambrano]] published ''[[Satanás (novel)|Satanás]]'', a novel that analyzes the case of Delgado. The book was very successful and received several international awards.{{According to whom|date=November 2016}} Mendoza Zambrano met Delgado at the university in Bogotá when he was a literature student, and he actually talked to Delgado just a couple of days before the massacre.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 2006, Colombian filmmakers Rodrigo Guerrero (producer) and Andi Baíz (director) adapted the book into a film, [[Satanás]].

'''Christian Dornier''' (born July 15, 1958 in Baume-les-Dames) is a [[France|French]] [[mass murder]]er who murdered his sister and mother and wounded his father with a [[Gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] [[double-barrelled shotgun]] at their farm on July 12, 1989. He then drove through the village of [[Luxiol]] and the adjacent area, shooting people at random. A total of fourteen people were killed and eight others injured in Dornier's half-hour rampage, before police managed to subdue him.

Dornier was diagnosed as suffering from [[schizophrenia]] and thus [[not guilty by reason of insanity|could not be held accountable for his crime]] according to French law, much to the anger of the victims' families.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RWMOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KIEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6637,3107279&amp;dq=dornier Farmer kills 14 persons during shooting rampage], ''[[The Prescott Courier]]'' (July 13, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; He has been treated in a [[psychiatric hospital]] in [[Sarreguemines]] since April 1991.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Life==
Christian Dornier was the oldest child of Georges and Jeanne Dornier; he had a sister named Corinne and a brother named Serge. Dornier served twelve months in the military around 1981, which apparently negatively affected him.&lt;ref name=ERG1407&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=C-lVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oOEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5401,3138345&amp;dq= Villagers expected slayer to 'create havoc one day'], ''[[Eugene Register-Guard]]'' (July 14, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Dornier was described as a reserved person who liked to read and work in the forest. According to his brother he had no friends and hardly talked to anyone,&lt;ref name=ERG1407/&gt; sometimes not talking to anyone in the nearby village of [[Luxiol]] for weeks.&lt;ref name=OCB1307&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Fh8VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tgYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2320,8564865&amp;dq=dornier French farmer kills 14 with shotgun from car], ''[[Ocala Star-Banner]]'' (July 13, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PM&gt;Luxiol: L'itineraire de l'horreur, ''[[Paris Match]]'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

One and a half years prior to the shooting, Dornier's father decided to retire and hand over the farm to him in three years. Dornier enrolled in a month-long agricultural course to prepare for taking over the farm, but he returned after a week, apparently broken. He shaved his head, began to smoke, abandoned his farm work, and became violent. Eventually Dornier's father decided not to cede the farm to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.lesoir.be/la-guerre-avait-fait-7-morts-a-luxiol-_t-19890714-Z01UE2.html?query=%22christian+dornier%22&amp;firstHit=0&amp;by=10&amp;sort=datedesc&amp;when=-1&amp;queryor=%22christian+dornier%22&amp;pos=4&amp;all=6&amp;nav=1 La guerre avait fait 7 morts à Luxiol], ''[[Le Soir]]'' (July 14, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Three months prior to the shooting, Dornier, together with his father, bought a [[Volkswagen Golf GTI]] because he wanted the choice to leave the farm whenever he wished.&lt;ref name=PM/&gt;

In the months prior to the rampage, Dornier fired shots at his father and his neighbour René Barrand, and pelted a woman with stones. The incidents were discussed at the village council, but it was decided that no action was needed since Dornier never had any trouble with the law. However, Dornier's family was advised to get him [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] help, while his father began to hide his guns.&lt;ref name=ERG1407/&gt;&lt;ref name=Soir2207&gt;[http://archives.lesoir.be/le-tueur-fou-de-luxiol-14-morts_t-19890722-Z01V1L.html?query=%22christian+dornier%22&amp;firstHit=0&amp;by=10&amp;sort=datedesc&amp;when=-1&amp;queryor=%22christian+dornier%22&amp;pos=3&amp;all=6&amp;nav=1 Le tueur fou de Luxiol], ''[[Le Soir]]'' (July 22, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Dornier was regularly visited by a psychiatrist from [[Baume-les-Dames]], who prescribed him [[tranquilizer]]s, but according to his brother he never took them.&lt;ref name=ERG1407/&gt; Dornier's parents considered putting him in a psychiatric hospital, but he became furious when his doctor talked to him about the matter and his mother eventually decided against it.&lt;ref name=Soir2207/&gt;

In July 1989, Dornier apparently had a [[nervous breakdown]] and didn't attend the wedding of his sister on July 8. Instead, he drove through the area the entire day.&lt;ref name=PM/&gt;&lt;ref name=SdC&gt;[http://scenedecrime.blogs.com/scenedecrime/2007/06/la_tuerie_de_lu.html La tuerie de Luxiol], ''Scene de crime'' (June 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shooting==
On July 12, 1989, Dornier refused to have lunch with his family. He moved the car of his brother-in-law, Daniel Maillard, out of the way of his own vehicle, and then waited in the kitchen, where he had hidden a double-barrelled shotgun behind a cupboard. The shotgun was earlier found by Maillard when it was overthrown by his dog, though he thought that Dornier's father had put it there after the previous shooting incidents.&lt;ref name=Soir2207/&gt;

At 14:30, when the car of cattle inseminator Marcel Lechine pulled up outside the house, Dornier, apparently thinking that his brother Serge had just arrived, grabbed the gun and killed Lechine upon entry. He then opened fire at his family, killing his sister by shooting her at point-blank range,&lt;ref name=LSJ1407&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=J4QpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O2UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1380,2200520&amp;dq= Village feared French mass killer], ''[[Lewiston Sun-Journal]]'' (July 14, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; and wounding his 63-year-old father with a shot to the neck. Dornier pursued his father to a neighbour's house and shot him again in his side. He then returned home and fatally wounded his mother while she was calling police.&lt;ref name=TB1307&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VQ0VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_AIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5975,2943232&amp;dq=dornier Man kills 14 in France, including mother, sister], ''[[Toledo Blade]]'' (July 13, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; She later died in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RQ01AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oKULAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4827,3460493&amp;dq= Farmer kills 14 in French gun rampage], ''[[The Glasgow Herald]]'' (July 13, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Maillard escaped the shooting unharmed because he was in the bathroom at that time and fled through a window.

Dornier packed more ammunition and left the farm in his car, driving around the area and shooting people at random. He first encountered 10-year-old Johann Robez-Masson and his adopted brother Johnny and killed them both as they were riding their bikes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hclUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aZEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2997,1941521&amp;dq= French killer 'solitary and wild'], ''[[Tha Age]]'' (July 14, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; From a distance of 300 metres he then killed Stanislas and Marie Périard; Louis Cuenot; and Louis Liard; and wounded six others, among them Juliette Périard; Jeanine Cuenot; a 14-year-old girl named Angeline; and René Barrand, who was shot in the head and legs. Dornier also shot at the latter's wife, Marie-Therese, who was standing in her kitchen.&lt;ref name=OCB1307/&gt; After he had killed the niece of [[Mayor]] Roger Clausse, five-year-old Pauline Faivre-Pierret&lt;ref name=LSJ1407/&gt;, and was about to reload his gun to shoot her aunt when Joel Clausse, the mayor's son, grabbed a gun and fired a shot at him.&lt;ref name=LSJ1407/&gt; Dornier, hit in the neck, then fled to continue his rampage elsewhere.

While Roger Clausse alerted police, Dornier drove towards [[Baume-les-Dames]], killing Louis Girardot on the way and shooting [[gendarme]] René Sarrazin in the arm. While being chased by 40 police officers&lt;ref name=TB1307/&gt;, he shot Georges Pernin and Marie-Alice Champroy at a crossroads {{ndash}} causing their cars to crash {{ndash}} and killed Pierre Boeuf.&lt;ref name=ERG1407/&gt; When he came to [[Verne, Doubs|Verne]], he was finally engaged by police and wounded in the stomach during a shootout before being taken into custody.&lt;ref name=SdC/&gt;

The reason for the shooting is not known, though it was speculated that Dornier was angry because his father had decided not to turn over the farm's management to him.&lt;ref name=RNT1307&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZqEHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ljUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2440,2416320&amp;dq= French farmer on spree kills mother, sister, 12 others], ''[[Rome News-Tribune]]'' (July 13, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Police recovered two suitcases at Dornier's farm, packed, among other things, with books and clothes, suggesting that he had planned to flee afterwards.&lt;ref name=Soir2207/&gt;

==Aftermath==

Dornier was kept under heavy guard in a hospital in [[Besançon]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=P6FEAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5rUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2562,1076234&amp;dq= French murderer under heavy guard], ''[[The Junction City Daily Union]]'' (July 14, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; On July 15 he was transferred to the [[Fresnes Prison|prison hospital in Fresnes]] and charged with fourteen counts of murder and eight counts of [[attempted murder]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PvhSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8IMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4443,5614569&amp;dq= French farmer charged in 14 slayings], ''[[The Deseret News]]'' (July 15, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Two psychiatrists were appointed to examine his mental state, and in November the same year they declared that Dornier was suffering from [[schizophrenia]], was therefore [[insanity defense|not responsible for his crimes]], and should be confined in a special facility for dangerous patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.lesoir.be/le-tireur-fou-de-luxiol_t-19891107-Z023UR.html?query=%22christian+dornier%22&amp;firstHit=0&amp;by=10&amp;sort=datedesc&amp;when=-1&amp;queryor=%22christian+dornier%22&amp;pos=2&amp;all=6&amp;nav=1 Le tireur fou de Luxiol], ''[[Le Soir]]'' (November 7, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings were confirmed in February 1990&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/478343.html L'auteur de la tuerie de Luxiol est jugé irresponsable], ''[[Le Monde]]'' (February 3, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; and so he was declared insane and transferred from the prison in [[Dijon]], where he was held in [[remand (detention)|remand]], to the mental hospital in [[Sarreguemines]] on April 18, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/525192.html Auteur de la tuerie de Luxiol (Doubs) Christian Dornier est interné], ''[[Le Monde]]'' (April 21, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dagmar Johanne Amalie Overby''' (23 April 1887 – 6 May 1929) was a [[Danish people|Danish]] [[serial killer]]. She murdered between 9 and 25 children – of which one was her own – during a seven-year period from 1913 to 1920. On March 3, 1921, she was [[Capital punishment in Denmark|sentenced to death]] in one of the most noted [[trial (law)|trials]] in [[History of Denmark|Danish history]]—one that changed [[legislation]] on [[childcare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

 | language = Danish
 | url = http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/170/bio/904/
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The sentence was later [[clemency|commuted]] to [[life in prison]].

Overby was working as a [[professional]] [[childcare|child caretaker]], caring for babies born [[Illegitimacy|outside of marriage]], murdering her own charges. She [[strangled]] them, [[drowned]] them or burned them to death in her [[masonry heater]]. The corpses were either [[cremated]], [[burial|buried]] or hidden in the [[loft]].

Overby was convicted of nine murders, as there were insufficient proof of the others. Her lawyer based the case on Overby being [[Child abuse|abused]] herself as a baby, but that did not impress the judge. She became one of the three women sentenced to death in Denmark in the 20th century, but she &amp;ndash; like the other two &amp;ndash; was reprieved.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

She died in prison on May 6, 1929, at age 42. Notes relating to her case are included in the [[Politihistorisk Museum]] (Museum of Police History) in [[Nørrebro]], [[Copenhagen]].

The Danish author [[Karen Søndergaard Koldste]] wrote a novel called ''Englemagersken'' (''The Angel Maker'') based on her.&lt;ref name=novel&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.englemagersken.dk/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103135034/http://englemagersken.dk/ |archive-date=2014-01-03 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Teatret ved Sorte Hest]] in Copenhagen has performed a play named ''Historien om en Mo(r)der'' (''Morder'' meaning "murderer" and ''moder'' meaning "mother") based on her life.

'''Daniel Camargo Barbosa''' (22 January 1930 – 13 November 1994) was a [[Colombian people|Colombian]] [[serial killer]]. It is believed that he [[raped]] and murdered up to 150 young girls in [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]] during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Early life==
Camargo's mother died when he was a little boy and his father was overbearing and emotionally distant. He was raised by an abusive stepmother, who punished him and sometimes dressed him in girls' clothing, making him a victim of ridicule in front of his peers.&lt;ref name="Infants and Virginity"&gt;{{cite news|title=La Infancia y La Virginidad: Dos Vertientes Del Crimen|newspaper=Hoy|date=15 November 1994|accessdate=31 March 2010|location=Ecuador|language=Spanish|trans-title=Children and Virginity: Twofold Crime|url=http://www.explored.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/la-infancia-y-la-virginidad-dos-vertientes-del-crimen-26963-26963.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125153025/http://www.explored.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/la-infancia-y-la-virginidad-dos-vertientes-del-crimen-26963-26963.html|archive-date=25 January 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes and imprisonment==
He was first arrested in [[Bogotá]] on 24 May 1958 for [[petty theft]].&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cronologia de los Asesinatos de Camargo Barbosa |newspaper=Hoy |date=15 November 1994 |accessdate=31 March 2010 |location=Ecuador |language=Spanish |trans-title=Timeline of the Murders of Barbosa Camargo |url=http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/cronologia-de-los-asesinatos-de-camargo-barbosa-26954-26954.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529160106/http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/cronologia-de-los-asesinatos-de-camargo-barbosa-26954-26954.html |archivedate=29 May 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camargo had a [[Common-law marriage|de facto union]] with a woman named Alcira and had two children with her. He fell in love with another woman, Esperanza (age 28), whom he planned to marry, but then found out that she was not a [[virgin]]. This became the root of Camargo's fixations. He and Esperanza formed an agreement that he would stay with her if she aided him in finding other virgin girls to have sex with. This began a period of their partnership in crime. Esperanza was Camargo's accomplice, luring young girls to an apartment under false pretenses and then drugging them with [[Secobarbital|sodium seconal]] [[Hypnotic|sleeping pills]] so that Camargo could [[rape]] them. Camargo committed five rapes in this way, but did not kill any of the girls. The fifth child that they abused in this way reported the crime, and both Camargo and Esperanza were arrested and taken to separate prisons.&lt;ref name="Infants and Virginity" /&gt; Camargo was convicted of sexual assault in Colombia on 10 April 1964.&lt;ref name="Sadistic"&gt;{{cite news|title='El sádico del Chanquito'|author=Special Envoy Jose Comas|newspaper=El Pais|date=2 February 1988|accessdate=31 March 2010|location=Spain|language=Spanish|trans-title=The Chanquito sadistic|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/COLOMBIA/ECUADOR/sadico/Chanquito/elpepiint/19880207elpepiint_5/Tes/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge sentenced Camargo to three years in prison, and Camargo was initially grateful for the perceived leniency of the judge, swearing to repent and mend his ways. However, a new judge was given precedence over the case and Camargo was sentenced to eight years in prison. This provoked Camargo to rebellious anger. He served his full sentence, and was then released.&lt;ref name="Infants and Virginity" /&gt;

In 1973 he was arrested in [[Brazil]] for being [[Undocumented immigrant|undocumented]]. Due to a delay in sending Camargo's criminal records from Colombia, he was [[deported]] and released with his false identity.&lt;ref name="Timeline" /&gt; When he returned to Colombia, he took up a job as a street vendor in [[Barranquilla]] selling [[Video monitor|television monitors]]. One day when passing by a school, he kidnapped a 9-year-old girl, after raping her, he murdered her so that she could not inform the police as his previous victim had done. This was his first assault involving murder.&lt;ref name="Infants and Virginity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadistic" /&gt;

Camargo was arrested on 3 May 1974 in Barranquilla, Colombia, when he returned to the scene of the crime to recover the television screens that he had left beside the victim. Even though it is believed that he raped and killed more than 80 girls in Colombia, Camargo was imprisoned in Colombia after being convicted of raping and killing a 9-year-old girl. He was initially sentenced to 30 years in prison, but this sentence was reduced to 25 years, and he was interned in the prison on the island of [[Gorgona, Colombia]]&lt;ref name="Infants and Virginity" /&gt; on 24 December 1977.&lt;ref name="Sadistic" /&gt;

==Escape from Colombia to Ecuador==
In November 1984 Camargo escaped from Gorgona prison (known as the Colombian [[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz]]) in a primitive boat after having carefully studied the [[ocean currents]]. The authorities assumed that he died at sea and the press reported that he had been eaten by [[shark]]s.&lt;ref name="Sadistic" /&gt; He eventually arrived in [[Quito]], Ecuador. He then traveled by bus to [[Guayaquil]] on 5 or 6 December 1984.&lt;ref name="Infants and Virginity" /&gt; On 18 December he abducted a 9-year-old girl from the city of [[Quevedo, Ecuador|Quevedo]], in the province of [[Los Ríos Province|Los Ríos]], Ecuador. The next day a 10-year-old girl also disappeared.

From 1984 to 1986 Camargo committed a series of at least 54 rapes and murders in Guayaquil. The police at first believed that all the deaths were the work of a gang, not understanding that one man could have killed so many. Camargo slept on the streets, and lived off of the money he could gain by reselling ballpoint pens in the streets. Occasionally he supplemented his income by selling clothing or small valuables belonging to his victims.&lt;ref name="Sadistic" /&gt;

==Modus operandi==
Camargo selected helpless, young, lower-class girls in search of work and approached them, pretending to be a foreigner who needed to find a Protestant pastor in a church on the outskirts of town. He explained that he had to deliver a large sum of money, which he showed them as proof, and he offered them a reward if they would accompany him to show him the way. He pretended that he was a stranger to the area, and hinted at the possibility of the girls getting a job at the factory. No one was suspicious of an older man accompanying a girl or young woman who could be his granddaughter. Camargo would then enter into the woods, claiming to be looking for a shortcut in order to avoid arousing suspicion in his victims. If the girls did grow suspicious and drew back, he did not prevent them from leaving. Camargo raped his victims before strangling them, sometimes stabbing them when they resisted. After his victims were dead, he left their bodies in the forest to be picked clean by [[scavenger]]s.&lt;ref name="Sadistic" /&gt;

==Arrest==
Camargo was arrested by two policemen in Quito on 26 February 1986, only a few minutes after he had murdered a 9-year-old girl named Elizabeth. The policemen were on patrol and approached him at the height of the avenue Los Granados, thinking that he was acting suspiciously. They found that he was carrying with him a bag containing the bloody clothes and clitoris of his latest victim, and a copy of ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' by [[Dostoyevsky]].&lt;ref name="Infants and Virginity"/&gt; He was taken into custody and later moved to Guayaquil for identification. When he was arrested he gave a false name, Manuel Bulgarin Solis, but he was later identified by one of his rape victims who escaped.&lt;ref name="Timeline" /&gt;

Daniel Camargo calmly confessed to killing 72 girls in [[Ecuador]] since escaping from the Colombian prison. He led authorities to the dumping grounds of those victims whose bodies had not yet been recovered. The bodies had been dismembered. While he told the Ecuadorian authorities of the locations of the bodies and how the sadistic crimes were committed, he showed no feelings of remorse. After raping his victims, he had hacked, slashed and crushed the girls with a [[machete]]. He gave a cynical explanation for choosing children. He wanted virgins "because they cried"; this apparently gave him greater satisfaction. According to Camargo, he killed because he wanted revenge on woman's unfaithfulness. He hated them for not being what he believed women were supposed to be.

==Interview==
In June 1986 Francisco Febres Cordero, a journalist for the newspaper ''[[Hoy (Ecuadorian newspaper)|Hoy]]'' (Today), managed to arrange an interview with Camargo. It was difficult to get the interview due to the police blocking all access to Camargo, and the fact that Camargo himself demanded a large fee before he would let himself be interviewed. The journalist pretended to be part of a group of psychologists that were allowed access to the prisoner, allowing him to ask Camargo questions without arousing his suspicion.&lt;ref name="Infants and Virginity" /&gt;

==Sentence==
Camargo was convicted in 1989 and sentenced to 16 years in prison, the maximum sentence available in Ecuador. While serving his sentence in the Garcia Moreno de Quito jail, he claimed to have converted to [[Christianity]]. In this penitentiary he was imprisoned with
[[Pedro López (serial killer)|Pedro Alonso López]] (also dubbed "the Monster of the Andes"), who is believed to have raped and killed more than 300 girls in Colombia, Ecuador and [[Peru]].

==Death==
On 13 November 1994, Camargo was stabbed to death in prison by Geovanny Noguera, who turned out to be the nephew of one of the victims. He was 64 years old at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-250868# |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610174559/http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-250868# |archive-date=10 June 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Lee Siebert''' (June 17, 1954 – April 22, 2008) was an American [[serial killer]]  on [[Alabama]]'s [[death row]]. He was convicted of three murders and confessed to at least five. During questioning he indicated that he was responsible for at least 12 deaths. Siebert died on April 22, 2008 in [[Holman Correctional Facility|Holman Prison]] near [[Atmore, Alabama|Atmore]] of complications from cancer.&lt;ref name="AP1"&gt;Hunter, Desiree. "[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-04-23-1743623889_x.htm Alabama death row inmate who challenged protocol dies]." ''[[Associated Press]]'' at ''[[USA Today]]''. April 23, 2008. Retrieved on March 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Killings==
Siebert's first known killing took place in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was convicted of manslaughter.&lt;ref name="newton"&gt;{{cite book| last = Newton| first = Michael| title = Hunting Humans: An Encyclopedia of Modern Serial Killers| isbn =}} Quoted in {{cite web| title = Daniel Lee Siebert| work = Murderpedia| url = http://www.murderpedia.org/male.S/s/siebert-daniel.htm| accessdate = 10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siebert was charged with the 1985 murders of two women in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref name="malnic1987"&gt;{{cite web| last = Malnic| first = Eric|author2=Jack Jones| title = Murderer in Alabama Confesses 2 L.A. Killings| work = Los Angeles Times| publisher =| date = March 28, 1987| url =http://articles.latimes.com/1987-03-28/local/me-750_1_serial-killings| accessdate = 10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, he murdered a student at the [[Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind]] in [[Talladega, Alabama|Talladega]] and her two children. Sherri Weathers had missed classes for over a week, and the school had worried that she had not contacted them with an explanation. A search of her apartment found her dead body, along with those of her two children.&lt;ref name="newton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="malnic1987" /&gt;

Investigation also revealed another student who was missing from the institute. Linda Jarman was found dead in her apartment, also murdered. He was also charged with the murder of Linda Odum, a waitress who he had been dating. She was reported missing in February and her remains discovered in March. Fingerprints linked Siebert to her stolen car. Police believed Siebert was also involved in the death of Sheryl Evans of Calhoun County, whose body was found around the same time.&lt;ref name="newton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="malnic1987" /&gt; Siebert was charged with the death of Beatrice McDougall in Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1986.&lt;ref name="malnic1987" /&gt; In custody, Siebert said he had committed 12 or more murders.&lt;ref name="newton" /&gt;

==Discovery==
An art teacher using the name "Daniel Spence" was questioned in connection with the crime after police were notified that he had an interest in Sherri Weathers. A check of Spence's [[fingerprint]]s revealed that he was in fact Daniel Siebert, who had a previous conviction of [[manslaughter]] in 1979 and was wanted on [[assault]] charges in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], California.&lt;ref name="newton" /&gt;

Siebert spent the next six months on the run. He was apprehended in [[Hurricane Mills, Tennessee]], after placing a phone call to a friend who reported him to the police. His next call was traced to a phone booth near a restaurant where he was working and he was arrested the following day when he showed up for work.&lt;ref name="malnic1987" /&gt;

==Imprisonment==

Siebert was convicted in the capital cases involving Jarman, and the case of Weathers and her children. Siebert's execution date was set for October 25, 2007 for the murders of Weathers and her children. Assistant Attorney General Clay Crenshaw said Siebert had exhausted all of his appeals for the killing of Weathers and her children.  Siebert had been undergoing treatment for [[pancreatic cancer]].  Siebert's execution was delayed hours before it was to occur.

He had the Alabama Institutional Serial #00Z475.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doc.state.al.us/deathrow.asp |title="Inmates on Deathrow." |accessdate=2007-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209184118/http://www.doc.state.al.us/deathrow.asp |archivedate=February 9, 2007 }} [[Alabama Department of Corrections]].

In 1975 he served as the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, one of the most influential parliamentary committees as it overseas all public sector companies, across ministerial lines.

==Chief Minister==
[[File:Darbara Singh ex-cm.png|thumb]]
In the state elections of 1980, he was elected to Punjab Legislative Assembly from Nakodar, and was appointed as Chief Minister on 17 February 1980. The 1980s were a turbulent time in the history of Punjab marked by an increase in violence and demand for a separate Sikh homeland, Singh remained Chief Minister for three years. During this time his government was grappling with the rising militancy in the state. There was a spate of assassinations, prime among them being the daylight murder of Lala Jagat Narain, Head of the Punjab Kesri group of newspapers of Jalandhar. This was followed by the assassination of DIG of Punjab Police Jalandhar range [[Avtar Singh Atwal]] outside the Golden Temple Complex. Due to an increase in terrorist violence, the tenure of the ministry was cut short. The Singh ministry resigned and [[President's Rule]] was imposed in the state under Art.356 of Indian Constitution on 6 June 1983.

Singh was elected to the [[Rajya Sabha]] in 1984, and served with distinction in Council of States being elected the Chairman of the House Committee in 1986.

'''David Curtiss "Steve" Stephenson''' (August 21, 1891 &amp;ndash; June 28, 1966) was a convicted murderer and rapist, who in 1923 was appointed [[Grand Dragon]] of the [[Indiana Klan|branch of the Ku Klux Klan]] in [[Indiana]] and head of Klan recruiting for seven other states. Later that year, he led those groups to independence from the [[Ku Klux Klan|national KKK organization]]. Amassing wealth and political power in Indiana politics, he was one of the most prominent national Klan leaders. "He was viewed as responsible for reviving the Klan and widening its base, and considered the most powerful man in Indiana".&lt;ref name=CL&gt;Criminal Law Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder&lt;/ref&gt; He had close relationships with numerous Indiana politicians, especially Governor [[Edward L. Jackson]].

In ''[[Stephenson v. State]]'' (1925) Stephenson was tried for and convicted of the abduction, rape, and murder of a young white woman, [[Madge Oberholtzer]], a state education official. His trial, conviction and imprisonment ended the portrayal of Klan leaders as law abiding. The case destroyed the Klan as a political force in Indiana, and significantly damaged its standing nationally.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt; Denied a pardon by Governor Jackson, in 1927 he started talking with reporters for the ''[[Indianapolis Times]]'' and released a list of elected and other officials who had been in the pay of the Klan. This led to a wave of indictments in Indiana, more national scandals, the rapid loss of tens of thousands of members, and the end of the second wave of Klan activity in the late 1920s.

==Early life and education==
Stephenson was born in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] on August 21, 1891, and moved as a child with his family to [[Maysville, Oklahoma]]. After some public schooling, he started work as a printer's apprentice and was active in the [[Populist Party of America|Populist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indianahistory.org/wp-content/uploads/d-c-stephenson-collection-1922-1978.pdf|title=D. C. Stephenson Collection, 1922-1978|website=|publisher=Indiana Historical Society|access-date=28 February 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], he enlisted in the [[United States Army|Army]] and completed officers' training. He never served overseas, but his training proved useful when he organized and led groups.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

==Klansman==

{{see also|Indiana Klan}}
In 1920 at the age of 29, he moved to [[Evansville, Indiana]], where he worked for a retail coal company. He joined the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and in 1922, ran unsuccessfully for a Democratic [[United States House of Representatives|Congressional]] nomination.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Ralph D.; ''Indiana History: A Book of Readings'' (1995), p 306. Indiana: Indiana University Press. {{ISBN|0-253-32629-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to have already "married and abandoned two wives" before settling in Evansville.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a1eSbL0kxk8C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Leonard J. Moore, ''Citizen Klansmen: The Ku Klux Klan in Indiana, 1921-1928''], Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1997, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph M. Huffington, whom the [[Ku Klux Klan]] had sent from Texas as an agent for organizing in Evansville, recruited Stephenson to the group's inner circle. The historian Leonard Moore characterized them as both young men on the make. The Evansville Klavern became the most powerful in the state, and Stephenson soon contributed to attracting numerous new members. More than 5,400 men, or 23 percent of the native-born white men in [[Vanderburgh County, Indiana|Vanderburgh County]], ultimately joined the Klan.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

Building on the momentum, Stephenson set up a base in [[Indianapolis]], where he helped create the Klan's state newspaper, ''Fiery Cross''. He quickly recruited new agents and organizers, building on news about the organization. [[Protestantism|Protestant]] ministers were offered free membership. From July 1922 to July 1923, nearly 2,000 new members joined the Klan each week in Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (1997), ''Citizen Klansmen'', pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hiram Wesley Evans]], who led recruiting for the national organization, maintained close ties to state leaders throughout 1921–1922 and he was especially close to Stephenson, because by then, Indiana had the largest state Klan organization. Stephenson backed Evans in November 1922 when he unseated [[William Joseph Simmons|William J. Simmons]] as [[Imperial Wizard]] of the national KKK. Evans had ambitions to make the Klan a political force in the country.

After Evans won, he officially appointed Stephenson as [[Grand Dragon]] of Indiana.  Privately he made him head of recruiting for seven other states north of [[Mississippi]]. In the 1920s, Klan membership grew dramatically in these states. In Indiana, membership grew to nearly 250,000 or about one third of all white males in the state. Stephenson acquired great wealth and political power by leading the Klan; agents received a portion of fees paid by new recruits, and he began to wield other powers.&lt;ref&gt;Rory McVeighn, "Structural incentives for conservative mobilization: Power devaluation and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, 1915–1925" ''Social Forces'' (1999) 77#4 pp: 1461-1496.&lt;/ref&gt; Evans, who had a monopoly on the sale of Klan uniforms and paraphernalia, appointed Stephenson as Grand Dragon of the Indiana Klan at a 1923 [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] gathering of the Klan in [[Kokomo, Indiana]], with more than 100,000 members and their families in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (1997), ''Citizen Klansmen'', pp. 17-19&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;My worthy subjects, citizens of the Invisible Empire, Klansmen all, greetings. It grieves me to be late. The President of the United States kept me unduly long counseling on matters of state. Only my plea that this is the time and the place of my coronation obtained for me surcease from his prayers for guidance.&lt;ref name="Lutholtz"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Encouraged by his success, in September 1923, Stephenson severed his ties with the existing national organization of the KKK, and formed a rival KKK that was made up of the chapters which he led. That year Stephenson changed his affiliation from the Democratic to [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|the Republican Party]], which was predominant in Indiana and much of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. He supported Republican [[Edward L. Jackson]], who was rumored to be a Klan member, when Jackson ran successfully for governor in 1924. Stephenson once claimed, "I am the law in Indiana."&lt;ref name="Lutholtz"/&gt;

Shortly after, on May 12, 1924, at an assembly in the [[Cadle Tabernacle]] in Indianapolis, he said:&lt;blockquote&gt;"God help the man who issues a proclamation of war against the Klan in Indiana now ... We are going to Klux Indiana as she has never been Kluxed before ... I'll appeal to the ministers of Indiana to do the praying for the Ku Klux Klan and I'll do the scrapping for it ... And the fiery cross is going to burn at every crossroads in Indiana, as long as there is a white man left in the state."&lt;ref&gt;"Grand Dragon: D.C. Stephenson and the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana" by M. William Lutholtz. West Lafayette, Indiana, Purdue University Press, 1991, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Convicted of murder==
Publicly a [[Prohibition|Prohibitionist]] and a defender of "[[Protestantism|Protestant]] womanhood," Stephenson was tried in 1925 for the rape and murder of [[Madge Oberholtzer]], a young state employee who ran a state program to combat adult illiteracy. During the trial, the Klan's image as upholders of law and morality were gravely weakened as it was proven that Stephenson and many of his associates were in private womanizers and alcoholics.&lt;ref name="Lutholtz"/&gt; The scandal of the charges and trial led to the rapid decline in  the "Second Wave" of Klan activity.&lt;ref name=vpappab&gt;[http://www.in.gov/library/2848.htm Ku Klux Klan in Indiana] Accessed December 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson was convicted of the abduction, forced intoxication, and rape of Oberholtzer. His abuse led to her suicide attempt while she was still in his captivity. Because the suicide attempt eventually caused Oberholtzer's death, Stephenson was also charged with murder.

Stephenson had bitten her many times during his attack. The attending doctor described her condition as consisting of a significant bite on her breast.&lt;ref name=docsteph /&gt;  He later testified that the bite wounds that Stephenson inflicted on her were a leading contributor to her death due to a [[staph infection]] that eventually reached her lungs. The doctor also testified that she could have been saved if she had been given medical attention sooner.&lt;ref name=docsteph&gt;[http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/stephenson/atatevstprosecution.html STEPHENSON v.

Stephenson was sentenced to life in prison on November 16, 1925.&lt;ref name="Lutholtz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lutholtz|first=M. William|title=Grand Dragon: D. C. Stephenson and the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana|publisher=Purdue University Press|year=1991|location=West Lafayette, Indiana|isbn=1-55753-046-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his conviction, Governor [[Edward L. Jackson]] refused to grant Stephenson clemency or commute his sentence. On September 9, 1927, Stephenson released lists of public officials who were or had been on the Klan payroll. The ''[[Indianapolis Times]]'' interviewed Stephenson and proceeded with an extended investigation of the Klan's political ties.&lt;ref name="Center"/&gt; (The ''Times'' won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] for its investigative reporting.&lt;ref name="Center"/&gt;) This publicity and the state's crackdown on Klan activity sped up the decline of the organization by the end of the 1920s. The KKK suffered a dramatic nationwide loss of reputation and its membership rapidly fell from 5 million in 1925; few Klan members were counted in the organization's former Midwestern stronghold soon after.

The state filed indictments against Governor Jackson; George V. "Cap" Coffin, chairman of the Marion County Republican Party; and attorney Robert I. Marsh, charging them with conspiring to bribe former Governor [[Warren McCray]]. The mayor of Indianapolis, [[John L. Duvall|John Duvall]], was convicted and sentenced to jail for 30 days (and barred from political service for four years). Some Republican commissioners of [[Marion County, Indiana|Marion County]] resigned from their posts after being charged with accepting bribes from the Klan and Stephenson.&lt;ref name="Center"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centerforhistory.org/learn-history/indiana-history/the-golden-era-of-indiana-1900-1941|title=Indiana and the Ku Klux Klan|publisher=Center for History|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507171643/http://centerforhistory.org/learn-history/indiana-history/the-golden-era-of-indiana-1900-1941|archive-date=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
On January 7, 1941, the [[Valparaiso, Indiana|Valparaiso]] ''[[Vidette-Messenger]]'' reported that Governor [[M. Clifford Townsend]], a Democrat, was considering granting an early parole to Stephenson. No parole was approved that year. Stephenson was paroled on March 23, 1950, by a Democratic administration, but violated parole by disappearing on or before September 25, 1950. On December 15, 1950, he was captured in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] and returned to custody. He was sentenced in 1951 to serve 10 years in prison. In 1953, he pleaded for release, denying that he had ever been a leader of the Klan. [[File:D.C. Stewphenson.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Grave marker located at USVA Mountain Home National Cemetery in Johnson City, Tennessee]] On December 22, 1956, the state paroled him, on condition that he leave Indiana and never return.&lt;ref name="Lutholtz"/&gt; Stephenson relocated to [[Seymour, Indiana]], where he soon married Martha Dickinson (they were separated less than a year later).

Stephenson then moved to [[Jonesborough, Tennessee]] (the town name was briefly spelled as "Jonesboro" during this time), where he was employed at the ''[[Herald &amp; Tribune]]'' newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;"Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan". By Todd Tucker&lt;/ref&gt; and where he also married Martha Murray Sutton without having been divorced from Dickinson.

In 1961, at the age of 70, Stephenson was arrested in [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], [[Missouri]], on charges of attempting to sexually assault a sixteen-year-old girl but he was later released after paying a $300 fine because the charges were dropped on grounds of insufficient evidence. He was ordered to leave Missouri immediately. &lt;ref name="Lutholtz"/&gt; A few years later, in 1966, Stephenson died at his home in [[Jonesborough, Tennessee]], and he was buried at the [[Mountain Home National Cemetery|USVA Mountain Home National Cemetery]] in [[Johnson City, Tennessee]].

'''Denis Sergeevich Pischikov '''(born April 12, 1983 in Bulanash, [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]], [[RSFSR]]), known as "'''The Shivering Creature'''"[why?], is a [[Russia]]n robber and [[serial killer]], who killed 14 elderly people between 2002 and 2003 in the [[Moscow Oblast]] and [[Vladimir Oblast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vsrf.ru/stor_pdf.php?id=99426|title=Кассационное определение по делу Писчикова}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Pischikov was born on April 12, 1983 in a loving family in the settlement of Bulanash, Svedlovsk Oblast, but was born with a [[congenital disease]]. His childhood was happy, but after the [[collapse of the USSR]] his father was left without work and soon died. All of the family's worries fell upon the shoulders of the mother, Lyuba Ivanovna, who worked at the Artyomovsk radio plant, who did not notice how her son was straying from the right path. Soon she married Alexander Anushin, an electric locomotive driver, but he turned out to be an alcoholic who did not even try to establish relationships with the child. Pischikov left school after the 5th grade, repeatedly running into the police for theft and [[hooliganism]]. Outwardly, he appeared to be a modest and shy boy.

Pischikov came to [[Moscow]] in June 2000.&lt;ref name="Губерния"&gt;{{cite web|author=Александр ТАРАСОВ.|year=2008|url=http://www.rpgazeta.ru/index2.php3?path=htm/2008/50&amp;source=7642|title=Идет маньяк по улице…|trans-title=There is a maniac on the street ...|publisher=Электронная газета "Губернiя"|accessdate=2010-04-19|language=ru|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he was arrested for attempting to steal the radio from a car. However, the mask of a modest fellow helped him, and he, having signed a written undertaking not to leave, disappeared. He was declared wanted on the federal list, but was not sought after seriously. Pischikov at first settled in the Vladimir Oblast with his friend, but soon after, he met a girl, with whom he began to live. At first, he worked on the construction of country houses, then at a tire store, but did not stay there for a long time. Subsequently, he deceived his partner that he worked, bringing home the money that he took from the homes of the retirees he killed.

The first murder carried out by Pischikov occurred on March 29, 2002 in the village of Pashnevo, in the [[Orekhovo-Zuyevsky District]]. He stole 3000 [[rubles]] from the house of the murdered pensioner Lebedev. The next murder occurred on November 8, 2002, in the village of Potochino, Moscow Oblast, but this time he had a smaller bounty of 700 rubles. He killed the next victim on January 17, 2003, but could not steal any money, since he did not find any in the house.

In a number of cases, Pischikov also took food from the refrigerator of the pensioners he killed, sometimes even while at the crime scenes. On March 18, 2003, Pischikov committed two consecutive murders in the village of Gubin in the Orekhovo-Zuevsky District, stealing 950 rubles and a piece of sausage. On March 31 of the same year, Pischikov committed two more murders in the village of Korovino, again in the Orekhovo-Zuevsky District, stealing a total of 1120 rubles from both murders. This suggested that Pischikov was not robbing - he was killing instead. On April 3, 2003, Pischikov committed his last murder in the village of Voinova Gora, killing a pensioner and his 50-year-old daughter. However, the daughter miraculously had survived.

Pischikov was arrested in the city of [[Likino-Dulyovo]]. When he was walking along the street and looking for another place to burglarize, he was noticed by a pensioner. He called the police and, at his own risk, began to pursue the perpetrator. Soon, Pischikov was arrested on a deserted street. He began to give evidence on the way to the police station, confessing to all the murders. He however did not repent to the questioners, and according to the investigators' stories: "''Pischikov did not even understand what else they wanted from him, except his cooperation with the investigation"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Дэвид Гамбург.|url=http://line-tv.ru/tv-peredachi/4439-kriminalnaja-rossija-tvar-drozhashhaja-smotret.html|date=2005|title=Документальный фильм из цикла "Криминальная Россия" - "Тварь дрожащая"|trans-title="A documentary from the series" Criminal Russia "-" The Creation of a Shivering " "|publisher=[[Первый канал (Россия)|Первый канал]]|accessdate=2010-04-19|language=ru|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/678fSEZ2L?url=http://line-tv.ru/tv-peredachi/4439-kriminalnaja-rossija-tvar-drozhashhaja-smotret.html|archivedate=2012-04-23|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, the court sentenced Denis Pischikov to [[life imprisonment]]. In a petition for [[clemency]], he wrote: "''Have pity on me! Anything but life!''". The [[Supreme Court of Russia]] upheld the verdict without change, after which Pischikov was sent to the [[White Swan (prison)|White Swan]] prison.

'''Dennis Andrew Nilsen''' (23 November 1945 – 12 May 2018) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[serial killer]] and [[necrophile]] who murdered at least twelve young men between 1978 and 1983 in [[London]], England. Convicted at the [[Old Bailey]] of six counts of murder and two of [[attempted murder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nilsen given 25-year sentence|first=David|last=Nicholson|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=5 November 1983|page=1|issue=61682}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nilsen was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on 4 November 1983, with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 25 years. In his later years, he was incarcerated at [[Full Sutton (HM Prison)|Full Sutton]] maximum security prison.

All of Nilsen's murders were committed in the two [[North London]] addresses in which he resided between 1978 and 1983. His victims would be lured to these addresses through guile and killed by [[strangulation]], sometimes accompanied by [[drowning]].
Following each murder, Nilsen would observe a ritual in which he bathed and dressed the victim's body, which he retained for extended periods of time, before [[dissection|dissecting]] and disposing of the remains by burning on a bonfire or flushing down a lavatory.

Nilsen became known as the '''Muswell Hill Murderer''', as he committed his later murders in the [[Muswell Hill]] district of North London. He died in prison on 12 May 2018.&lt;!-- PER WP:LEADCITE WE DON'T NEED SOURCES IN THE LEAD FOR MATERIAL WHICH IS SOURCED ELSEWHERE --&gt;

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Dennis Andrew Nilsen was born on 23 November 1945 in [[Fraserburgh]], [[Aberdeenshire]], the second of three children born to Elizabeth Duthie Whyte, and Olav Magnus Moksheim (who had adopted the surname [[Nilsen]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jamie|last=Buchan|title=Author inspired by serial killer Nilsen|work=[[The Press and Journal (Scotland)|The Press and Journal]]|publisher=[[Aberdeen Journals]]|location=Aberdeen, Scotland|date=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a Norwegian soldier who had travelled to Scotland in 1940 as part of the [[Norwegian resistance movement|Free Norwegian Forces]], following the [[German occupation of Norway]]. After a brief courtship, he married Elizabeth Whyte in May 1942 and the newlyweds moved into her parents' house.

The marriage between Nilsen's parents was difficult. Olav Nilsen did not view married life with any seriousness, being preoccupied with his duties with the Free Norwegian Forces, and making little attempt to spend much time with or find a new home for his wife.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=40}} After the birth of her third child, Nilsen's mother concluded she had "rushed into marriage without thinking". The couple divorced in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=N.J.|last=Edison|title=The World's Most Infamous Killers|year=2003|page=79|publisher=Chancellor Press|location=London, England|isbn=978-0-753-70715-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three of the couple's children — Olav Jr., Dennis and Sylvia — had been conceived on their father's brief visits to the mother's household. Her parents, Andrew and Lily (née Duthie) Whyte (who had never approved of their daughter's choice of husband), were supportive of their daughter following her divorce, and considerate of their grandchildren.

Nilsen was a quiet yet adventurous child. His earliest childhood memories were of family picnics in the Scottish countryside with his mother and siblings, of his grandparents' [[piety|pious]] lifestyle (which he later described as "cold and dour"{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=24}}), and of being taken on long countryside walks carried on the shoulders of his maternal grandfather, to whom he was particularly close. Olav Jr. and Sylvia occasionally accompanied Dennis and his grandfather on these walks. Despite only being 5 years old, Nilsen vividly recalled these walks as being "very long ... along the harbour, across the wide stretch of beach, up to the sand-dunes, which rise thirty feet behind the beach ... and on to [[Inverallochy and Cairnbulg|Inverallochy]]".{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=43}} He later described this stage of his childhood as one of contentment,{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=42}} and his grandfather being his "great hero and protector", adding that whenever his grandfather (who was a fisherman) was at sea, "Life would be empty [for me] until he returned".

By 1951, Nilsen's grandfather's health was in decline, but he continued to work. On 31 October 1951, while fishing in the [[North Sea]], he died of a [[heart attack]] at the age of 62.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=45}} His body was brought ashore and returned to the Nilsen family home prior to burial. In what Nilsen later described as his most vivid childhood recollection, his mother, weeping, asked him whether he wanted to see his grandfather.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=45}}{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=184}} When he replied that he did, he was taken into the room where his grandfather lay in an open coffin. As he gazed upon the body, his heart beat strongly as his mother told him his grandfather was sleeping,{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=46}} adding that his grandfather had "gone to a better place".{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=32}}

In the years following the death of his grandfather, Nilsen became more quiet and withdrawn, often standing alone at the harbour watching the herring boats. At home, he seldom participated in family activities and retreated from any attempts by adult family members to demonstrate any affection towards him. He grew to resent what he saw as the unfair amount of attention his mother, grandmother and later, stepfather displayed towards his older brother and younger sister. Nilsen envied Olav's popularity. He often talked to or played games with his younger sister, Sylvia, to whom he was closer than any other family member.

On one of his solo excursions to the beach at Inverallochy, in 1954 or 1955, Nilsen became submerged beneath the water and was almost dragged out to sea. Nilsen initially panicked, flailing his arms and shouting. As he "gasped for air which wasn't there"{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=50}} he recalled believing that his grandfather was about to arrive and pull him out, before experiencing a sense of tranquillity. His life was saved by another youth who dragged him ashore.

Shortly after this incident, Nilsen's mother moved out of his grandparents' home and into a flat with her three children. She later married a builder named Andrew Scott, with whom she had four more children in as many years. Although Nilsen initially resented his stepfather (whom he viewed as an unfair [[disciplinarian]]), he gradually came to grudgingly respect him.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=57}} The family moved to [[Strichen]] in 1955.

At the onset of puberty, Nilsen discovered he was [[homosexuality|homosexual]], which initially confused and shamed him. He kept his sexuality hidden from his family and his few friends. Because many of the boys to whom he was attracted had similar facial features as his younger sister, Sylvia, on one occasion he sexually [[fondling|fondled]] her, believing that his attraction towards boys might be a manifestation of the care he felt for her.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|pp=43–44}} He made no efforts to seek sexual contact with any of the peers to whom he was sexually attracted, although he later said he had been fondled by an older youth and did not find the experience unpleasant.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=44}} On one occasion, he also caressed and fondled the body of his older brother as he slept.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=60}} As a result of this, Olav Jr. began to suspect his brother was homosexual and regularly belittled him in public — referring to Dennis as "hen" (Scottish [[slang]] for "girl").{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=43}} Nilsen initially believed that his fondling of his sister may have been evidence that he was [[bisexuality|bisexual]].

As Nilsen progressed into adolescence, he found life in Strichen increasingly stifling, with limited entertainment amenities or career opportunities. He respected his parents' efforts to provide and care for their children, but began to resent the fact that his family was poorer than most of his peers, with his mother and stepfather making no effort to better their lifestyles; thus, Nilsen seldom invited his friends to the family home.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=57}} At the age of 14, he joined the [[Army Cadet Force]], viewing the [[British Army]] as a potential avenue for escaping his rural origins.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|pp=47–48}}

===Army service===
Nilsen's scholastic record was above average.&lt;ref&gt;''Serial Killers''. p 126.&lt;/ref&gt; He displayed a flair for both history and art, but shunned sports. He finished his schooling in 1961 and briefly worked in a canning factory as he considered which career path he should choose.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=61}} After three weeks at the factory, Nilsen informed his mother that he intended to join the army, where he intended to train as a chef. Nilsen passed the entrance examinations and received official notification he was to enlist for nine years' service in September 1961, commencing his training with the [[Army Catering Corps]] at [[Aldershot Garrison|St. Omer Barracks]] in [[Aldershot]]. Within weeks, Nilsen began to excel in his army duties; he later described his three years of training at Aldershot as "the happiest of my life".{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=63}} He relished the travel opportunities afforded him in his training, and recalled as a highlight his regiment taking part in a ceremonial parade attended by both [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] and [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Lord Montgomery of Alamein]].

While stationed at Aldershot, Nilsen's latent homosexual feelings began to stir, but he kept his sexual orientation well hidden from his colleagues. Nilsen never showered in the company of his fellow soldiers for fear of developing an [[erection]] in their presence; instead opting to bathe alone in the bathroom, which also afforded him the privacy to [[Masturbation|masturbate]] without discovery.&lt;ref&gt;''Dennis Nilsen: Conversations With Britain's Mose Evil Serial Killer'' {{ISBN|978-1-782-19459-0}} pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1964, Nilsen passed his initial catering exam and was officially assigned to the 1st Battalion of the [[Royal Fusiliers]] in [[Osnabrück]], [[West Germany]], where he served as a [[Private (rank)|private]]. In this deployment, Nilsen began to increase his intake of alcohol. He described himself and his colleagues as a "hard-working, boozy lot"; his colleagues recalled he often drank to excess in order to ease his shyness. On one occasion, Nilsen and a German youth drank themselves into a stupor. When Nilsen awoke, he found himself on the floor of the German youth's flat. No sexual activity had occurred, but this incident fuelled Nilsen's [[sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]], which initially involved his sexual partner — invariably a young, slender male — being completely passive. These fantasies gradually evolved into his partner being unconscious{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=72}} or dead. On several occasions, Nilsen also made tentative efforts to have his own prone body sexually interfered with by one of his colleagues. In these instances, whenever he and his colleagues drank to excess, Nilsen would pretend he was inebriated in the hope one of his colleagues would make sexual use of his supposedly unconscious body.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=79}}

Following two years of service in Osnabrück, Nilsen returned to Aldershot, where he passed his official catering exam before being deployed to serve as a cook for the British Army in Norway. In 1967, he was deployed to the [[State of Aden]] (formerly [[Aden Colony]]), where he again served as a cook at the [[Al-Mansoura (Aden)|Al Mansoura Prison]]. This posting was more dangerous than his previous postings in West Germany or Norway, and Nilsen later recalled his regiment losing several men, often in ambushes en route to the army barracks. Nilsen was kidnapped by an Arab taxi driver, who beat him unconscious and placed him in the boot of his car. Upon being dragged out of the boot of the taxi, Nilsen grabbed a jack-handle and knocked the taxi driver to the floor before beating him unconscious. He then locked the man in the boot of the taxi.{{sfn|Masters|1985|pp=66–67}}

Unlike his previous postings, Nilsen had his own room while stationed in Aden. This afforded him the privacy to masturbate without discovery. His developed fantasies of sex with an unresistant or deceased partner unfulfilled, Nilsen compensated by imagining sexual encounters with an unconscious body as he masturbated while looking at his own prone, nude body in a mirror.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=86}} On one occasion, Nilsen discovered that, by using a free-standing mirror, he could create an effect whereby if positioning the mirror so his head was out of view, he could visualise himself engaged in a sexual act with another man. To Nilsen, this ruse created the ideal circumstance in which he could visually "split" his personality: in these masturbatory fantasies, Nilsen alternately envisaged himself as being both the domineering and the passive partner.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|pp=86–87}} These fantasies gradually evolved to incorporate his own near-death experience with the Arab taxi driver, the dead bodies he had seen in Aden, and imagery within a 19th-century oil painting entitled ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', which depicts an old man holding the limp, nude body of a dead youth as he sits aside the [[dismemberment|dismembered]] body of another young male.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=138}} In his most vividly recalled fantasy, a slender, attractive young blonde soldier who had been recently killed in battle is dominated by a faceless "dirty, grey-haired old man" who washed this body before engaging in intercourse with the spreadeagled corpse.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=87}}
[[File:Théodore Géricault "The raft of the Medusa".jpg|thumb|right|Detailed section of ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]''. The old man holding the nude, limp body of the deceased young male was incorporated by Nilsen into his masturbatory fantasies.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=138}}]]

When Nilsen completed his deployment in Aden he returned to Britain and was assigned to serve with the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] at Seaton Barracks in [[Plymouth]]. Throughout his service with this regiment, Nilsen was required to cook for thirty soldiers and two officers on a daily basis. He served at these barracks for one year before being transferred with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to [[Cyprus]] in 1969. Months later, the regiment was transferred to [[Berlin]], where, the same year, Nilsen had his first sexual experience with a female: a prostitute whose services he solicited. He bragged of this sexual encounter to his colleagues, but later stated he found [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] with a female both "over-rated" and "depressing".{{refn|group=n|Nilsen had repeatedly engaged in sexual relations with an Arab youth while previously stationed in Aden.{{sfn|Masters|1985|pp=69–71}}}}

Following a brief period with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in [[Inverness]], Nilsen was selected to cook for the [[Queen's Guard|Queen's Royal Guard]] before, in January 1971, being reassigned to serve as a cook for a different regiment in the [[Shetland Islands]], where he ended his 11-year military career at the rank of [[corporal]] in October 1972.{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=188}}{{refn|group=n|Nilsen later claimed to have opted to end his military career due to his disillusionment regarding the conduct of the British Army on [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]]; this claim would later be refuted by a former colleague who—having stressed Nilsen had been a known "[[Pseudointellectual|pseudo-intellectual]]" among his colleagues—stated: "I have often been struck by how journalists assume what he says is actually true", before adding that a violent fight between Nilsen and a roommate had—alongside other disciplinary issues—been the true reason his military service had ended in 1972.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|pp=99–100}}}}

Between October and December 1972, Nilsen lived with his family as he considered his next career move. On more than one occasion in the three months Nilsen lived in Strichen, his mother voiced her opinion as to her being more concerned with Nilsen's lack of female companionship than his career path, and of her desire to see him marry and start a family. On one occasion, Nilsen joined his older brother Olav Jr., his sister-in-law, and another couple to watch a documentary about male homosexuality. All present viewed the topic with derision, except Dennis, who ardently spoke in defence of [[gay rights]]. A fight ensued, after which Olav Jr. informed his mother that Dennis was homosexual.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=82}} Dennis never spoke to his older brother again, and maintained only sporadic written contact with his mother, stepfather and younger siblings. He decided to join the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], and moved to London in December to begin the training course.{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=189}}

==Move to London==

===Employment===
In April 1973 Nilsen completed his training and was posted to [[Willesden Green]]. As a junior constable, Nilsen performed several arrests but never had to physically subdue a member of the public. Nilsen enjoyed the work, but missed the comradeship of the army.{{sfn|Masters|1985|pp=83–84}} He began to drink alone in the evenings. During the summer and autumn of 1973, Nilsen began frequenting gay pubs and engaged in several [[casual sex|casual liaisons]] with men. He viewed these encounters as "soul-destroying" and a "vain search for inner peace"{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=85}} as he sought a lasting relationship. In August, following a failed relationship, Nilsen came to the conclusion that his personal lifestyle was at odds with his professional life. His birth father died the same month, leaving each of his three children £1,000. In December, Nilsen resigned from the police.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=85}}

Between December 1973 and May 1974, Nilsen worked as a security guard. The work was intermittent, and he resolved to find more stable, secure employment. He found work as a [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|civil servant]] in May 1974.{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=190}} Nilsen was initially posted to a Jobcentre in [[Denmark Street]], where his primary role was to find employment for unskilled labourers.{{sfn|Persaud|Masters|Wilson|Campbell|1997|p=21}} At his workplace, Nilsen was known to be a quiet, conscientious employee, who was active in the [[trade union]] movement. His attendance record was mediocre, although he frequently volunteered to work overtime. In 1979, Nilsen was appointed acting executive officer.{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=200}} He was officially promoted to the position of [[Civil_Service_(United_Kingdom)#Grading_schemes|executive officer]], with additional supervisory responsibilities, in June 1982, and transferred to another Jobcentre in [[Kentish Town]], continuing in this job until his arrest.{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=200}}

===Melrose Avenue===
In November 1975, Nilsen encountered a 20-year-old man named David Gallichan being threatened outside a pub by two other men. Nilsen intervened in the altercation and took Gallichan to his room at 80 Teignmouth Road in the [[Cricklewood]] district of London. The two men spent the evening drinking and talking; Nilsen learned that Gallichan had recently moved to London from [[Weston-super-Mare]], was homosexual, unemployed and resided in a hostel. The following morning, both men agreed to live together in a larger residence and Nilsen — using part of the inheritance bequeathed to him by his father{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=93}} — immediately resolved to find a larger property. Several days later, the pair viewed a vacant ground floor flat at 195 Melrose Avenue, also in Cricklewood, and they decided to move into the property. Prior to moving in, Nilsen negotiated a deal with the landlord whereby he and Gallichan had exclusive use of the garden at the rear of the property.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=92}}

The flat was supposed to be furnished, but upon moving in, Nilsen and Gallichan found it to be largely threadbare. Over the following months, Nilsen and Gallichan redecorated and furnished the entire flat. Much of this work was performed by Gallichan, as Nilsen — having discovered Gallichan's lack of employment ambitions — began to view himself as the [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] in their relationship. Nilsen later recollected that he was sexually attracted to Gallichan, but the pair seldom had intercourse.{{refn|group=n|Gallichan would later inform police that he was sexually "uninterested" in Nilsen.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=93}}}}

Initially, Nilsen experienced domestic contentment with Gallichan; within a year of their moving to Melrose Avenue, the superficial relationship between the two men began to strain. They slept in separate beds, and both began to bring home casual sexual partners.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=94}} Gallichan insisted Nilsen had never been violent towards him, but he was regularly berated by Nilsen, and by early 1976, the pair began arguing with increasing frequency. Nilsen later stated that, following a heated argument in May 1977, he had demanded Gallichan leave the residence. (Gallichan later informed investigators that he had chosen to end the relationship.){{sfn|Masters|1985|p=95}} Nilsen formed brief relationships with several other young men over the following eighteen months; none of these relationships lasted more than a few weeks, and none of the men expressed any intention of living with Nilsen on a permanent basis.

By late 1978, Nilsen was living a solitary existence; he had experienced at least three failed relationships in the previous eighteen months, and he later confessed to having developed an increasing conviction that he was unfit to live with. Throughout 1978, he devoted an ever-increasing amount of his time, effort and assiduity to his work,{{sfn|Masters|1985|pp=95–96}} and most evenings he spent consuming spirits and/or lager as he listened to music.

==Murders==
Between 1978 and 1983, Nilsen is known to have killed a minimum of twelve men and boys, and to have attempted to kill seven others (he initially confessed in 1983 to having killed fifteen victims). The majority of Nilsen's victims were homeless or homosexual men; others were heterosexual people he typically met in bars, on public transport or — on one occasion — outside his own home.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=122}} All of Nilsen's murders were committed inside the [[North London]] addresses where he alternately resided in the years he is known to have killed. His victims were lured to these addresses through guile — typically the offer of alcohol and/or shelter.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=190}}

Inside Nilsen's home, the victims were usually given food and alcohol, then [[strangulation|strangled]] — typically with a [[Ligature strangulation|ligature]] — either to death or until they had become unconscious. If the victim had been strangled into unconsciousness, Nilsen then drowned him in his bathtub, his sink or a bucket of water before observing a ritual in which he bathed, clothed and retained the bodies inside his residences for several weeks or, occasionally, months before he dismembered them. Each victim killed between 1978 and 1981 at his Cricklewood residence was disposed of via burning upon a bonfire. Prior to their dissection, Nilsen removed their internal organs,&lt;ref&gt;''Serial Killers''. p 144.&lt;/ref&gt; which he disposed of either beside a fence behind his flat, or close to [[Gladstone Park, London|Gladstone Park]].{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=235}} The victims killed in 1982 and 1983 at his [[Muswell Hill]] residence were retained at his flat, with their flesh and smaller bones flushed down the lavatory.

Nilsen admitted to engaging in masturbation as he viewed the nude bodies of several of his victims, and to have engaged in sexual acts with six of his victims' bodies,{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=132}} but was adamant he had never [[Sexual penetration|penetrated]] any of his victims.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=119}}

===195 Melrose Avenue===
Nilsen killed his first victim, 14-year-old Stephen Holmes, on 30 December 1978. Holmes encountered Nilsen in the Cricklewood Arms pub, where Holmes had unsuccessfully attempted to purchase alcohol. According to Nilsen, he had been drinking heavily alone on the day he met Holmes, before deciding in the evening he must "at all costs" leave his flat and seek company.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=108}} He invited Holmes to his house with the promise of the two drinking alcohol and listening to music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nilsen describes how he murdered his first victim|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1533738/Nilsen-describes-how-he-murdered-his-first-victim.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=10 November 2006|first=Neil|last=Tweedie|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; believing him to be approximately 17 years old. At Nilsen's home, both Nilsen and Holmes drank heavily before they fell asleep. The following morning, Nilsen awoke to find Holmes asleep on his bed. In his subsequent written confessions, Nilsen stated he was "afraid to wake him in case he left me". After caressing the sleeping youth, Nilsen decided Holmes was to "stay with me over the New Year whether he wanted to or not".{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=120}} Reaching for a [[necktie]], Nilsen straddled Holmes as he strangled him into unconsciousness, before drowning the youth in a bucket filled with water. Nilsen twice masturbated over the body, before stowing the youth's corpse beneath his floorboards. Holmes' bound corpse remained beneath the floorboards for almost eight months, before Nilsen built a bonfire in the garden behind his flat and burned it on 11 August 1979.{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=194}}

Reflecting on his killing spree in 1983, Nilsen stated that, having killed Holmes: "I caused dreams which caused death ... this is my crime",{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=134}} adding that he had "started down the avenue of death and possession of a new kind of [[roommate|flatmate]]".{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=109}}

On 11 October 1979, Nilsen attempted to murder a student from [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] named Andrew Ho, whom he had met in a [[St Martin's Lane]] pub and lured to his flat on the promise of sex. Nilsen attempted to strangle Ho, who managed to flee from his flat and reported the incident to police. Nilsen was questioned in relation to the incident, but Ho decided not to press [[Criminal charge|charges]].&lt;ref name=Marriott&gt;{{cite book|last=Marriott|first=Trevor|title=The Evil Within|year=2012|publisher=Blake|location=London|isbn=978-1-857-82798-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/evilwithintopmur0000marr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months after the attempted murder of Ho, on 3 December 1979, Nilsen encountered a 23-year-old Canadian student named Kenneth Ockenden,&lt;ref&gt;''Serial Killers''. p 137.&lt;/ref&gt; who had been on a tour of England visiting relatives.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=117}} Nilsen encountered Ockenden as they both drank in a [[West End of London|West End]] pub. Upon learning the youth was a tourist, Nilsen offered to show Ockenden several London landmarks, an offer which Ockenden accepted. Nilsen then invited the youth to his house on the promise of a meal and further drinks. The pair stopped at an [[off licence]] en route to Nilsen's Melrose Avenue residence and purchased whisky, rum and beer, with Ockenden insisting on sharing the bill.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=117}} Nilsen was adamant he could not recall the precise moment he strangled Ockenden, but recalled that he strangled the youth with the cord of his (Nilsen's) headphones as Ockenden listened to music. He also recalled dragging the youth across his floor with the wire wrapped around his neck as he strangled him, before pouring himself half a glass of rum and continuing to listen to music upon the headphones with which he had strangled Ockenden.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=200}}

The following day, Nilsen purchased a [[Instant camera|Polaroid]] camera and photographed Ockenden's body in various suggestive positions. He then lay Ockenden's corpse [[Spreadeagle (position)|spreadeagled]] above him on his bed as he watched television for several hours, before wrapping the body in plastic bags and stowing the corpse beneath the floorboards. On approximately four occasions over the following fortnight, Nilsen disinterred Ockenden's body from beneath his floorboards and seated the body upon his armchair alongside him as he himself watched television and drank alcohol.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=119}}

Nilsen killed his third victim, 16-year-old Martyn Duffey, on 17 May 1980. Duffey was a catering student from [[Birkenhead]], who had hitchhiked to London without his parents' knowledge on 13 May after being questioned by the [[British Transport Police]] for evading his train fare. For four days, Duffey had slept rough near [[Euston railway station]] before Nilsen encountered the youth as he returned from a union conference in [[Southport]].{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=202}} Duffey, Nilsen recollected, was both exhausted and hungry, and happily accepted Nilsen's offer of a meal and a bed for the evening. After the youth had fallen asleep in Nilsen's bed, Nilsen fashioned a ligature around his neck, then simultaneously sat on Duffey's chest and tightened the ligature with a "great force". Nilsen held this grip until Duffey became unconscious; he then dragged the youth into his kitchen and drowned him in his sink&lt;ref&gt;''The Black Museum'' {{ISBN|978-0-316-90332-5}} p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; before bathing with the body — which he recollected as being "the youngest-looking I had ever seen."

Duffey's body was first placed upon a kitchen chair, then upon the bed on which he had been strangled. The body was repeatedly kissed, complimented and caressed by Nilsen, both before and after he had masturbated while sitting upon the stomach of the corpse. For two days, Duffey's body was stowed in a cupboard,{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=203}} before Nilsen noted signs of bloating; therefore, "he went straight under the floorboards".

Following Duffey's murder, Nilsen began to kill with increasing frequency. Before the end of 1980, he killed a further five victims and attempted to murder one other; only one of these victims whom Nilsen murdered, 26-year-old William David Sutherland, has ever been identified. Nilsen's recollections of the unidentified victims were vague, but he graphically recalled how each victim had been murdered and just how long the body had been retained before dissection. One unidentified victim killed in November had moved his legs in a cycling motion as he was strangled (Nilsen is known to have absented himself from work between 11 and 18 November,{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=197}} likely due to this particular murder); another unidentified victim Nilsen had unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate, before sinking to his knees and sobbing, before standing to expressly spit at his own image as he looked at himself in the mirror.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=138}} On another occasion, he had lain in bed alongside the body of an unidentified victim as he listened to the classical theme ''[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]''{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=124}} before bursting into tears.

Inevitably, the accumulated bodies beneath his floorboards attracted insects and created a foul odour — particularly throughout summer months. On occasions when Nilsen disinterred victims from beneath the floorboards, he noted that the bodies were covered with [[pupae]] and infested with maggots; some victims' heads had maggots crawling out of [[eye socket]]s and mouths.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=212}} Nilsen placed deodorants beneath the floorboards and sprayed [[insecticide]] about the flat twice daily, but the odour of decay and the presence of flies remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0VhEAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT148&amp;lpg=PT148&amp;dq=Dennis+Nilsen+deodorants+floorboards+flies#v=onepage&amp;q=Dennis+Nilsen+deodorants+floorboards+flies&amp;f=false|title=Dennis Nilsen – Conversations with Britain's Most Evil Serial Killer|first=Russ|last=Coffey|date=5 August 2013|publisher=John Blake Publishing|accessdate=13 May 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781782197195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1980, Nilsen removed and dissected the bodies of each victim killed since December 1979 and burned them upon a communal bonfire he had constructed on waste ground behind his flat.{{sfn|Waddell|1993|pp=196–197}} To disguise the smell of the burning flesh of the six dissected bodies placed upon this pyre, Nilsen crowned the bonfire with an old car tyre. Three neighbourhood children stood to watch this particular bonfire, and Nilsen later wrote in his memoirs that he felt it would have seemed "in order" if he had seen these three children "dancing around a mass funeral pyre".{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=142}} When the bonfire had been reduced to ashes and cinders, Nilsen used a rake to search the debris for any recognisable bones. Noting a skull was still intact,{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=142}} he smashed it to pieces with his rake.

On or about 4 January 1981, Nilsen encountered an unidentified man whom he described for investigators as an "18-year-old, blue-eyed" young Scot{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=210}} at the Golden Lion pub in [[Soho]]; he was lured to Melrose Avenue upon the promise of partaking in a [[Drinking game|drinking contest]]. After Nilsen and this victim had consumed several beverages, Nilsen strangled him with a tie, and subsequently placed the body beneath the floorboards. Nilsen is known to have informed his employers he was ill and unable to attend work on 12 January in order that he could dissect both this victim and another unidentified victim he had killed approximately one month earlier.{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=198}} By April, Nilsen had killed two further unidentified victims: one of whom he described as an English [[skinhead]] whom he had met in [[Leicester Square]]; the other he described as "[[Belfast]] boy"; a man in his early 20s, approximately 5&amp;nbsp;ft. 9 in height. In relation to the first of these three unidentified victims, Nilsen later casually reflected: "End of the day, end of the drink, end of a person ... floorboards back, carpet replaced, and back to work at Denmark Street".{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=143}}

The final victim to be murdered at Melrose Avenue was 23-year-old Malcolm Barlow, whom Nilsen discovered slumped against a wall outside his home on 17 September 1981. When Nilsen enquired as to Barlow's welfare, he was informed the medication Barlow was prescribed for his [[epilepsy]] had caused his legs to weaken. Nilsen suggested that Barlow should be in hospital and, supporting him, walked him into his residence before phoning for an ambulance.{{sfn|Persaud|Masters|Wilson|Campbell|1997|p=16}} The following day, Barlow was released from hospital and returned to Nilsen's home, apparently to thank him. He was invited in and, after eating a meal, began drinking rum and coke before falling asleep on the sofa. Nilsen [[manual strangulation|manually strangled]] Barlow as he slept, before stowing his body beneath his kitchen sink the following morning.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=123}}

In mid-1981, Nilsen's landlord decided to [[renovation|renovate]] 195 Melrose Avenue,{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=195}} and asked Nilsen to vacate the property. Nilsen was initially resistant to the proposal, but accepted an offer of £1,000 from his landlord to vacate the residence. He moved into an attic flat at 23D Cranley Gardens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/11988371/Would-you-buy-the-former-flat-of-one-of-Britains-worst-serial-killers.html |title=Would you buy the former flat of one of Britain's worst serial killers? |first=Lauren |last=Davidson |date=12 November 2015 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Muswell Hill district of north London on 5 October 1981.{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=195}} The day before he vacated the property, Nilsen burned the dissected bodies of the last five victims he had killed at this address upon a third and final bonfire he constructed in the garden behind his flat. Again, Nilsen ensured the bonfire was crowned with an old car tyre to disguise the smell of burning flesh (Nilsen had already dissected the bodies of four of these victims in January and August,{{sfn|Waddell|1993|pp=198–199}} and only needed to complete the dissection of Barlow for this third bonfire).

===23 Cranley Gardens===
At Cranley Gardens, Nilsen had no access to a garden, and as he resided in an attic flat, he was unable to stow any bodies beneath his floorboards. For almost two months, any acquaintances Nilsen encountered and lured to his flat were not assaulted in any manner,{{sfn|Persaud|Masters|Wilson|Campbell|1997|p=21}} although he did attempt to strangle a 19-year-old student named Paul Nobbs on 23 November 1981,{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=199}} but stopped himself from completing the act.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|pp=221-222}}{{refn|group=n|This act of attempted murder was committed while Nobbs was asleep in a drunken stupor. As such, he had no memory of the assault.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|pp=221-222}}}}

In March 1982, Nilsen encountered 23-year-old John Howlett while drinking in a pub near Leicester Square. Howlett was lured to Nilsen's flat on the promise of continuing drinking with Nilsen.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=224}} There, both Nilsen and Howlett drank as they watched a film, before Howlett walked into Nilsen's front room and fell asleep in the bed (which was located in the front room at this time). One hour later, Nilsen unsuccessfully attempted to rouse Howlett, then sat on the edge of the bed drinking rum as he stared at Howlett, before deciding to kill him.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=126}} Following a ferocious struggle (in which Howlett himself attempted to strangle his attacker), Nilsen strangled Howlett into unconsciousness with an upholstery strap before returning to his living room, shaking from the "stress of the struggle" in which he had believed he would be overpowered. On three occasions over the following ten minutes, Nilsen unsuccessfully attempted to kill this victim after noting he had resumed breathing, before deciding to fill his bathtub with water and drown him.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=127}} For over a week following Howlett's murder, Nilsen's own neck bore the victim's finger impressions.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=128}}
[[File:Cranley Gardens, Muswell Hill - geograph.org.uk - 1088900.jpg|right|thumb|Cranley Gardens, [[Muswell Hill]]. Nilsen occupied an attic flat. His practice of flushing dissected body parts down the lavatory led to his arrest.]]

In May 1982, Nilsen encountered Carl Stottor, a 21-year-old homosexual, as the youth drank at [[the Black Cap]] pub in [[Camden Town|Camden]].{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=200}} Nilsen engaged Stottor in conversation, discovering the youth was [[depression (mood)|depressed]] following a failed relationship. After plying the youth with alcohol,{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=211}} Nilsen invited Stottor to his flat, assuring his guest he had no intention of sexual activity. At the flat, Stottor consumed further alcohol before falling asleep upon an open sleeping bag; he later awoke to find himself being strangled with Nilsen loudly whispering, "Stay still".{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=212}}

In his subsequent testimony at Nilsen's trial, Stottor stated he initially believed Nilsen was trying to free him from the zip of the sleeping bag, before he returned to a state of unconsciousness. He then vaguely recalled hearing "water running" before realising he was immersed in the water and that Nilsen was attempting to drown him. After briefly succeeding in raising his head above the water, Stottor gasped the words, "No more, please! No more!" before Nilsen again submerged Stottor's head beneath the water.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=212}}

Believing he had killed Stottor, Nilsen seated the youth in his armchair, then noted his [[mongrel]] dog, Bleep, licking Stottor's face. Nilsen realised the tiniest thread of life still clung in the youth: he rubbed Stottor's limbs and heart to increase [[Circulatory system|circulation]], covered the youth's body in blankets, then lay him upon his bed. When Stottor regained consciousness, Nilsen embraced him; he then explained to Stottor he had almost strangled himself on the zip of the sleeping bag, and that he had [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|resuscitated]] him. Over the following two days, Stottor repeatedly lapsed in and out of consciousness. When Stottor had regained enough strength to question Nilsen as to his recollections of being strangled and immersed in cold water, Nilsen explained he had become caught in the zip of the sleeping bag following a nightmare, and that he had placed him in cold water as "you were in shock". Nilsen then led Stottor to a nearby railway station, where he informed the youth he hoped they might meet again before he bade him farewell.

Three months after Nilsen's June 1982 promotion to the position of executive officer in his employment, he encountered a 27-year-old named Graham Allen attempting to hail a taxi in [[Shaftesbury Avenue]]. Allen accepted Nilsen's offer to accompany him to Cranley Gardens for a meal. As had been the case with several previous victims, Nilsen stated he could not recall the precise moment he had strangled Allen, but recalled approaching him as he sat eating an [[omelette]] with the full intention of murdering him.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=128}} Allen's body was retained in the bathtub for a total of three days before Nilsen began the task of dissecting his body upon the kitchen floor. Nilsen is again known to have informed his employers he was ill and unable to attend work on 9 October 1982 — likely in order that he could complete the dissection of Allen's body.{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=201}}

On 26 January 1983, Nilsen killed his final victim, 20-year-old Stephen Sinclair. Sinclair was last seen by acquaintances in the company of Nilsen, walking in the direction of a [[London Underground|tube station]]. At Nilsen's flat, Sinclair fell asleep in a drug- and alcohol-induced stupor in an armchair as Nilsen sat listening to the rock opera ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]].''{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=129}} Nilsen approached Sinclair, knelt before him and said to himself, "Oh Stephen, here I go again",{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=300}} before strangling Sinclair with a ligature constructed with a necktie and a rope. Noting [[elastic bandage|crepe bandages]] upon each of Sinclair's wrists, Nilsen removed these to discover several deep slash marks from where Sinclair had recently tried to kill himself.

Following his usual ritual of bathing the body, Nilsen lay Sinclair's body upon his bed, applied talcum powder to the body, then arranged three mirrors around the bed before himself lying naked alongside the dead youth. Several hours later, he turned Stephen's head towards him, before kissing the youth's body on the forehead and saying, "Goodnight, Stephen". Nilsen then fell asleep alongside the body.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=302}} As had been the case with both Howlett and Allen, Sinclair's body was subsequently dissected, with various dismembered parts wrapped in plastic bags and stored in either a wardrobe, a tea chest or within a drawer located beneath the bathtub. The bags used to seal Sinclair's remains were sealed with the same crepe bandages Nilsen had found upon Sinclair's wrists.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=160}} Nilsen attempted to dispose of the flesh, internal organs and smaller bones of all three victims killed at Cranley Gardens by flushing their dissected remains down his toilet. In a practice which he had conducted upon several victims killed at Melrose Avenue, he also boiled the heads, hands and feet to remove the flesh off these sections of the victims' bodies.

On 4 February 1983, Nilsen wrote a letter of complaint to estate agents complaining that the drains at Cranley Gardens were blocked, and that the situation for both himself and the other [[Leasehold estate|tenants]] at the property was intolerable.{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=202}} The following day, he refused to allow an acquaintance to enter his property (the reason being he had begun to dismember Sinclair's body on the floor of his kitchen).

==Discovery and arrest==
Nilsen's murders were first discovered by a [[Dyno-Rod]] employee, Michael Cattran, who responded to the plumbing complaints made by both Nilsen and other tenants of 23 Cranley Gardens on 8 February 1983.{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=117}} Opening a drain cover at the side of the house, Cattran discovered the drain was packed with a flesh-like substance and numerous small bones of unknown origin. Cattran reported his suspicions to his supervisor, Gary Wheeler. As Cattran had arrived at the property at dusk, he and Wheeler agreed to postpone further investigation into the blockage until the following morning. Prior to leaving the property, Nilsen and a fellow tenant named Jim Allcock convened with Cattran to discuss the source of the substance. Upon hearing Cattran exclaim how similar the substance was in appearance to human flesh, Nilsen replied: "It looks to me like someone has been flushing down their Kentucky Fried Chicken."{{sfn|Coffey|2013|pp=15–16}}

At 7:30{{nbsp}}a.m. the following morning, Cattran and Wheeler returned to 23 Cranley Gardens, by which time the drain had been cleared. This aroused the suspicions of both men. Cattran discovered some scraps of flesh and four bones in a pipe leading from the drain which linked to the top flat of the house. To both Cattran and Wheeler, the bones looked as if they originated from a human hand. Both men immediately called the police who, upon closer inspection, discovered further small bones and scraps of what looked to the naked eye like either human or animal flesh in the same pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dennis Nilsen: Serial killer Dies in Prison Aged 72|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44097196|accessdate=15 December 2019|work=BBC News|date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These remains were taken to the mortuary at [[Hornsey]], where [[pathologist]] [[David Bowen (pathologist)|Professor David Bowen]] advised police that the remains were human,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8446356/Professor-David-Bowen.html |work=[[The Sunday Telegraph]]|location=London | title=Professor David Bowen | date=12 April 2011|accessdate=23 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that one particular piece of flesh he concluded had been from a human neck bore a ligature mark.

Upon learning from fellow tenants that the top floor flat from where the human remains had been flushed belonged to Nilsen, [[Detective Chief Inspector]] Peter Jay and two colleagues opted to wait outside the house until Nilsen returned home from work. When Nilsen returned home, DCI Jay introduced himself and his colleagues; explaining they had come to enquire about the blockage in the drains from his flat. Nilsen asked why the police were interested in his drains and also if the two officers present with Jay were [[Environmental health officer|health inspectors]]. In response, Jay informed Nilsen the other two were also police officers and requested access to his flat to discuss the matter further.

The three officers followed Nilsen into his flat, where they immediately noted the odour of rotting flesh.{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=119}} Nilsen queried further as to why the police were interested in his drains, to which he was informed the blockage had been caused by human remains. Nilsen feigned shock and bewilderment, stating, "Good grief, how awful!" In response, Jay replied: "Don't mess about, where's the rest of the body?" Nilsen responded calmly, admitting that the remainder of the body could be found in two plastic bags in a nearby wardrobe, from which DCI Jay and his colleagues noted the overpowering smell of decomposition emanated. The officers did not open the cupboard, but asked Nilsen if there were any other body parts to be found, to which Nilsen replied: "It's a long story; it goes back a long time. I'll tell you everything. I want to get it off my chest. Not here — at the police station". He was then [[arrested]] and [[Right to silence in England and Wales|cautioned]] on suspicion of murder, before being taken to Hornsey police station. As he was escorted to the police station, Nilsen was asked whether the remains in his flat belonged to one person or two. Staring out of the window of the police car, he replied, "Fifteen or sixteen, since 1978".{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=119}}

That evening, a Detective Superintendent Chambers accompanied DCI Jay and Professor Bowen to Cranley Gardens, where the plastic bags were removed from the wardrobe and taken to Hornsey mortuary. One bag was found to contain two dissected torsos, one of which had been vertically dissected, and a shopping bag containing various internal organs. The second bag contained a human skull almost completely devoid of flesh, a severed head, and a torso with arms attached but hands missing. Both heads were found to have been subjected to moist heat.{{sfn|Persaud|Masters|Wilson|Campbell|1997|pp=5–6}}

===Confession===
In an interview conducted on 10 February, Nilsen confessed there were further human remains stowed in a tea chest in his living room, with other remains inside an upturned drawer in his bathroom. The dismembered body parts were the bodies of three men, all of whom he had killed by strangulation — usually with a necktie. One victim he could not name;{{sfn|Wilson|1992|p=130}} another he knew only as "John the Guardsman",{{sfn|Persaud|Masters|Wilson|Campbell|1997|p=6}} and the third he identified as Stephen Sinclair. He also stated that, beginning in December 1978, he had killed "twelve or thirteen" men at his former address, 195 Melrose Avenue. Nilsen also admitted to having unsuccessfully attempted to kill approximately seven other people, who had either escaped or, on one occasion, had been at the brink of death but had been [[Resuscitation|revived]] and allowed to leave his residence.

A further search for additional remains at 23 Cranley Gardens on 10 February revealed the lower section of a torso and two legs stowed in a bag in the bathroom, and a skull, a section of a torso, and various bones in the tea chest.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=16}} The same day, Nilsen accompanied police to Melrose Avenue, where he indicated the three locations in the rear garden where he had burned the remains of his victims (investigators discovered over 1,000 fragments of bone from the garden at Melrose Avenue, many of them blackened and charred by fire).{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=157}}

Michael Cattran contacted the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' on 10 February,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Serial Murderers'' {{ISBN|1-854-35834-0}} p.129&lt;/ref&gt; informing the newspaper of the ongoing search for human remains at Cranley Gardens, leading the newspaper to break the story and spark intense national media interest.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/12/world/grim-search-for-london-murder-victims.html|title=Grim Search For London Murder Victims|accessdate=7 May 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 February 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 11 February, reporters from the ''Mirror'' had obtained photographs from Nilsen's mother in Aberdeenshire,{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=19}} which appeared on their front page the following day.{{refn|group=n|As further details were revealed to the press over the following days revealing that Nilsen had confessed to murdering more people than any other person in British criminal history,&lt;ref&gt;''Serial Murderers'' {{ISBN|1-854-35834-0}} p.150&lt;/ref&gt; the case attracted international press attention.}}

[[File:Dennis Nilsen The Mirror February 1983.png|upright|right|thumb|The 12 February 1983 front page of the ''[[Daily Mirror]],'' describing Nilsen having been formally charged with the murder of his last victim, Stephen Sinclair]]
Under [[English law]], the police had 48 hours in which to charge Nilsen or release him. Assembling the remains of the victims killed at Cranley Gardens on the floor of Hornsey mortuary, Professor Bowen was able to confirm the [[fingerprint]]s on one body matched those on police files of Sinclair. At 5:40 pm on 11 February, Nilsen was charged with Sinclair's murder, and a statement revealing this was released to the press. Formal questioning of Nilsen began the same evening,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/nilsen/confess_6.html/|work=[[truTV]]|first=Katherine|last=Ramsland|title=Nilsen's Confession|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022024124/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/nilsen/confess_6.html|archivedate=22 October 2012|via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Nilsen agreeing to be represented by a solicitor (a facility he had earlier declined). Police interviewed Nilsen on sixteen separate occasions over the following days, in interviews which totaled over 30 hours.

Nilsen was adamant he was uncertain as to why he had killed, simply saying, "I'm hoping you will tell me that" when asked his [[Motive (law)|motive]] for the murders. He was adamant the decision to kill was not made until moments before the act of murder. Most victims had died by strangulation;{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=150}} on several occasions, he had drowned the victims once they had been strangled into unconsciousness. Once the victim had been killed, he typically bathed the victim's body, shaved any hair from the torso to conform it to his physical ideal,{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=206}} then applied makeup to any obvious blemishes upon the skin. The body was usually dressed in socks and underpants, before Nilsen draped the victims' around him as he talked to the corpse.{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=137}} With most victims, Nilsen masturbated as he stood alongside or knelt above the body, and Nilsen confessed to having occasionally engaged in [[intercrural sex]] with his victims' bodies, but repeatedly stressed to investigators he had never actually penetrated his victims — explaining that his victims were "too perfect and beautiful for the pathetic ritual of commonplace sex".{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=130}}

All the victims' personal possessions were destroyed following the ritual of bathing their bodies in an effort to obliterate their identity prior to their murder and their now becoming what Nilsen described as a "prop" in his fantasies.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=200}} In several instances, Nilsen talked to the victim's body as it remained seated in a chair or prone on his bed,{{sfn|Wilson|1992|p=138}} and he recalled being emotional as he marvelled at the beauty of their bodies. With reference to one victim, Kenneth Ockenden, Nilsen noted that Ockenden's "body and skin were very beautiful", adding the sight "almost brought me to tears".{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=137}} Another, unidentified victim had been so [[emaciation|emaciated]] that he had simply been discarded under the floorboards.

The bodies of the victims killed at his previous address were kept for as long as [[human decomposition|decomposition]] would allow: upon noting any major signs of decomposition, Nilsen stowed it beneath his floorboards. If a body did not display any signs of decomposition, he occasionally alternately stowed it beneath the floorboards and retrieved it before again masturbating as he stood over or lay alongside the body. Make-up was again applied to "enhance its appearance" and to obscure blemishes.

When questioned as to why the heads found at Cranley Gardens had been subjected to moist heat, Nilsen stated that he had frequently boiled the heads of his victims in a large cooking pot on his stove in order that the internal contents [[evaporation|evaporated]], thus removing the need to dispose of the brain and flesh. The torsos and limbs of the three victims killed at this address were dissected within a week or so of their murder before being wrapped in plastic bags and stowed in the three locations he had indicated to police; the internal organs and smaller bones he flushed down the toilet. This practice — which had led to his arrest — had been the only method he could consider to dispose of the internal organs and soft tissue as, unlike at Melrose Avenue, he had no exclusive use of the garden of the property.

At Melrose Avenue, Nilsen typically retained the victims' bodies for a much longer period before disposing of the remains. He kept "three or four" bodies stowed beneath the floorboards before he dissected the remains, which he would wrap inside plastic bags and either return under the floorboards or, in two instances, place inside suitcases which had been left at the property by a previous tenant. The remains stowed inside suitcases — those of Ockenden and Duffey — were placed inside a shed in the rear garden, and were disposed of upon the second bonfire Nilsen had constructed at Melrose Avenue.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=212}} Other dissected remains — minus the internal organs — were returned beneath the floorboards or placed upon a bonfire he had constructed in the garden.

Nilsen confirmed that on four occasions, he had removed the accumulated bodies from beneath his floorboards and dissected the remains, and on three of these occasions, he had then disposed of the accumulated remains upon an assembled bonfire. On more than one occasion, he had removed the internal organs from the victims' bodies and placed them in bags, which he then typically dumped behind a fence to be eaten by wildlife. All the bodies of the victims killed at Melrose Avenue were dismembered after several weeks or months of internment beneath the floorboards. Nilsen recalled that the [[putrefaction]] of these victims' bodies made this task exceedingly vile; he recalled having to fortify his nerves with whisky and having to grab handfuls of salt with which to brush aside maggots from the remains. Often, he vomited as he dissected the bodies,{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=142}} before wrapping the dismembered limbs inside plastic bags and carrying the remains to the bonfires. Nonetheless, immediately prior to his dissecting the victims' bodies, Nilsen masturbated as he knelt or sat alongside the corpse.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=221}} This, he stated, was his symbolic gesture of saying goodbye to his victims.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=212}}

When questioned as to whether he had any remorse for his crimes, Nilsen replied: "I wished I could stop, but I couldn't. I had no other thrill or happiness".{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=150}} He also emphasised that he took no pleasure from the act of killing, but "worshipped the art and the act of death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/6924956.Dennis_Nilsen|title=Dennis Nilsen Quotes (Author of The Most Toys)|website=www.goodreads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal charges==
On 11 February 1983, Nilsen was officially charged with the murder of Stephen Sinclair.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=52}} He was transferred to [[HM Prison Brixton|Brixton Prison]] to be held on [[Remand (detention)|remand]] until his trial.

According to Nilsen, upon being transferred to Brixton Prison to await trial, his mood was one of "resignation and relief", with his belief being that he would be viewed, in accordance with law, as innocent until proven guilty. Nilsen objected to wearing a prison uniform while on remand. In protest at having to wear a prison uniform and what he interpreted to be breaches of prison rules, Nilsen threatened to protest against his remand conditions by refusing to wear any clothes; as a result of this threat, he was not allowed to leave his cell. On 1 August, Nilsen threw the contents of his [[chamber pot]] out of his cell, hitting several prison officers.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=179}} This incident resulted in Nilsen being found guilty on 9 August of assaulting prison officers and subsequently spending 56 days in solitary confinement.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=52}}

On 26 May, Nilsen was committed to stand trial at the [[Old Bailey]] on five counts of murder and two of attempted murder (a sixth murder charge was later added). Throughout this [[committal procedure|committal hearing]], Nilsen was represented by a solicitor named Ronald Moss, whom he had previously dismissed as his legal representation on 21 April,{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=177}} before Moss was again reappointed as Nilsen's legal representative after Nilsen had complained to magistrates he had been afforded no facilities with which he could mount his own defence. Moss was to remain Nilsen's legal representative until July 1983, when Nilsen — again expressing his intention to defend himself — discharged his legal aid, until 5 August when Nilsen once again reappointed Ronald Moss as his legal representative.

Initially, Nilsen had intended to plead guilty to each charge of murder at his upcoming trial.{{sfn|Persaud|Masters|Wilson|Campbell|1997|p=27}} With Nilsen's full consent, Ronald Moss had fully prepared Nilsen's defence; five weeks before his trial, Nilsen again dismissed the legal services of Ronald Moss, and opted instead to be represented by [[Ralph Sam Haeems|Ralph Haeems]], upon whose advice Nilsen agreed to plead not guilty by [[diminished responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[truTV]]|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/nilsen/sentencing_8.html/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022024056/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/nilsen/sentencing_8.html|archivedate=22 October 2012|first=Katherine|last=Ramsland|title=Pre-Trial Preparations|via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:UK - London (2808602458).jpg|220px|right|thumb|The [[Old Bailey]]. Nilsen was brought to trial at this location on 24 October 1983]]

==Trial and sentence==
Nilsen was brought to trial on 24 October 1983, charged with six counts of murder and two of attempted murder. He was tried at the Old Bailey before [[David Croom-Johnson|Mr Justice Croom-Johnson]].{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=201}} The trial began with Nilsen being asked by the chief administrator of the court whether he entered a plea of guilty or not guilty in relation to each charge. In response to each charge, Nilsen entered a plea of not guilty. Upon completion of his pleas, the jury was sworn into the courtroom.

The primary dispute between the [[prosecution|prosecuting]] and defence counsel was not whether Nilsen had committed murder, but his state of mind before, during and after the murders. The prosecuting counsel, [[Allan Green (barrister)|Allan Green]], argued that Nilsen was [[sanity|sane]], in full control of his actions, and had killed with [[Premeditated murder|premeditation]]. The defence counsel, [[Ivan Lawrence]], argued that Nilsen suffered from diminished responsibility, rendering him incapable of forming the actual intention to commit murder, and should therefore be convicted of [[manslaughter]] as opposed to murder.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=219}}{{sfn|Persaud|Masters|Wilson|Campbell|1997|p=27}}

The prosecution counsel opened the case for [[the Crown]] by describing the events of February 1983 leading to the identification of human remains in the drains at Cranley Gardens and Nilsen's subsequent arrest, the discovery of three dismembered bodies in Nilsen's property, his detailed confession, his leading investigators to the charred bone fragments of twelve further victims killed at Melrose Avenue, and the efforts he had taken to conceal his crimes. In a tactful reference to the primary dispute between opposing counsels at the trial, Green closed his opening speech with a reply Nilsen had given to police in response to a question as to whether he needed to kill: "At the precise moment of the act [of murder], I believe I am right in doing the act". To counteract this argument, Green added: "The Crown says that even if there was mental abnormality, that was not sufficient to diminish substantially his responsibility for these killings".

The first witness to testify for the prosecution was Douglas Stewart, who testified that in November 1980, he had awoken in Nilsen's flat to find his ankles bound and Nilsen strangling him as Nilsen straddled him. Successfully overpowering Nilsen, Stewart testified that Nilsen had then shouted, "Take my money!" This, the prosecution attested, reflected Nilsen's rational, cool presence of mind in that he hoped to be overheard by other tenants. Upon leaving Nilsen's residence, Stewart had reported the attack to police, who in turn questioned Nilsen. Noting conflicting details in accounts given by both men, police had dismissed the incident as a lovers' quarrel.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=206}} Upon [[cross-examination]], the defence counsel sought to undermine Stewart's credibility, pointing to minor inconsistencies in the testimony, the fact he had consumed much alcohol on the night in question, and suggesting his memory had been selectively magnified as he had previously sold his story to the press.

On 25 October the court heard testimony from two further men who had survived attempts by Nilsen to strangle them. The first of these, Paul Nobbs, provided testimony which the prosecution asserted was evidence of Nilsen's self-control and ability to refrain from homicidal impulses. A university student, Nobbs testified that he accompanied Nilsen to Cranley Gardens for alcohol and sex and woke in the early hours of the morning with "a terrible headache". Upon washing his face in Nilsen's bathroom, as Nobbs noted his eyes were bloodshot and his face completely red, Nilsen had exclaimed, "God! You look bloody awful!" Nilsen then advised the youth to see a doctor. Nobbs had not reported the attack to police for fear of his sexuality being discovered. Contrary to the prosecution claims, the defence counsel asserted that Nobbs' testimony reflected Nilsen's rational self being unable to control his impulses. The fact Nilsen had selected a university student as a potential victim was at odds with the prosecution's claim that Nilsen intentionally selected rootless males whose disappearance was unlikely to be noted.

Immediately after the testimony of Nobbs had concluded, Carl Stottor took the stand to recount how, in May 1982, Nilsen had attempted to strangle and drown him, before bringing him "back to life". Stottor's voice frequently quavered with emotion as he recounted how Nilsen had repeatedly attempted to drown him in his bathtub as he pleaded in vain for his life to be spared, and how he later awoke to find Nilsen's mongrel dog licking his face; on several occasions, the judge had to allow Stottor time to regain his composure. (The evidence provided by Stottor was not included as part of the [[indictment]] against Nilsen as his whereabouts were not known until after the indictment had been completed.){{sfn|Masters|1985|p=202}}
{{quote box
| quote = "When under pressure of work and extreme pain of social loneliness and utter misery, I am drawn compulsively to a means of temporary escape from reality. This is achieved by taking increased amounts of alcohol and plugging into stereo music which mentally removes me to a high plane of ecstasy, joy and tears. This is a totally emotional experience ... I relive experiences from childhood to present, taking out the bad bits. When I take alcohol, I see myself drawn along and moved out of my isolated, prison flat. I bring [with me] people who are not always allowed to leave because I want them to share my experiences and high feeling."
| source = Written statement made by Nilsen to DCI Peter Jay, February 1983.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=254}}
| width = 30em
}}
DCI Jay then recounted the circumstances of Nilsen's arrest and his "calm, matter-of-fact" confessions, before reading to the court several statements volunteered by Nilsen following his arrest. In one of these statements, Nilsen had said: "I have no tears for my victims; I have no tears for myself, nor those [[Grief|bereaved]] by my actions". Jay admitted it was unusual for anyone accused of such horrific crimes to be so forthcoming in providing information,{{sfn|Persaud|Masters|Wilson|Campbell|1997|p=31}} and conceded upon questioning by defence counsel that Nilsen not only provided most of the evidence against himself, but also encouraged the discovery of evidence which could contradict his own version of events. Following Jay's testimony, DS Chambers recited Nilsen's formal confession to the court. This testimony included graphic descriptions of the ritualistic and sexual acts Nilsen performed with his victims' bodies, his various methods of storage of bodies and/or body parts, dismemberment and disposal, and the problems decomposition — particularly regarding colonies of maggots — afforded him. Several jurors were visibly shaken throughout this testimony; others looked at Nilsen with incredulous expressions on their faces{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=218}} as Nilsen listened to the testimony with apparent indifference. This testimony lasted until the following morning, when the prosecution included several exhibits into evidence. This included the cooking pot in which Nilsen had boiled the heads of the three victims killed at Cranley Gardens, the cutting board he had used to dissect John Howlett, and several rusted catering knives which had formerly belonged to victim Martyn Duffey.

Two [[psychiatrist]]s testified on behalf of the defence. The first of these, Dr. James MacKeith, began his testimony on 26 October. MacKeith testified as to how, through a lack of emotional development,{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=258}} Nilsen experienced difficulty expressing any emotion other than anger,{{sfn|Persaud|Masters|Wilson|Campbell|1997|p=34}} and his tendency to treat other human beings as components of his fantasies. The psychiatrist also described Nilsen's association between unconscious bodies and [[sexual arousal]]; stating that Nilsen possessed [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] traits, an impaired sense of identity, and was able to depersonalise other people. He stated his conclusions that Nilsen displayed many signs of maladaptive behaviour, the combination of which, in one man, was lethal.{{sfn|Persaud|Masters|Wilson|Campbell|1997|p=34}} These factors could be attributed to an [[Personality disorder not otherwise specified|unspecified personality disorder]] from which MacKeith believed Nilsen suffered. In response to prosecution contention that, in attributing an unspecified disorder to Nilsen, MacKeith was undecided in his conclusions,{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=260}} MacKeith contended that this unspecified personality disorder was severe enough to substantially reduce Nilsen's responsibility.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=220}}

The second psychiatrist to testify for the defence, Dr. Patrick Gallwey, diagnosed Nilsen with a "borderline, false-self as if pseudo-normal, [[narcissistic personality disorder]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-03/news/vw-8020_1_dennis-nilsen|title=Book Review: True Crime : Understanding the Mind of a Serial Killer : Killing For Company: The Case of Dennis Nilsen|accessdate=15 February 2017|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=3 January 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; with occasional outbreaks of [[Schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] disturbances that Nilsen managed most of the time to keep at bay; Gallwey stated that, in episodic breakdowns, Nilsen became predominantly schizoid — acting in an impulsive, violent and sudden manner. Gallwey further added that someone suffering from these episodic breakdowns is most likely to disintegrate under circumstances of social isolation. In effect, Nilsen was not guilty of "[[malice aforethought]]". Upon cross-examination, Green largely focused upon the degree of awareness shown by Nilsen and his ability to make decisions. Gallwey conceded that Nilsen was intellectually aware of his actions, but stressed that, due to his personality disorder, Nilsen did not appreciate the criminal nature of his actions.

On 31 October, the prosecution called Dr. Paul Bowden to testify in [[rebuttal]] of the psychiatrists who had testified for the defence. Prior to Nilsen's trial, Bowden had interviewed the defendant on sixteen separate occasions in interviews totalling over fourteen hours. Over two days, Dr. Bowden testified that, although he found Nilsen to be abnormal in a colloquial sense, he had concluded Nilsen to be a manipulative person who had been capable of forming relationships, but had forced himself to objectify people.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|pp=266–267}} Refuting the testimony of MacKeith and Gallwey, Bowden further testified he had found no evidence of maladaptive behaviour, and that Nilsen suffered from no disorder of the mind.

Following the closing arguments of both prosecution and defence, the jury retired to consider their verdict on 3 November 1983. The following day, the jury returned with a majority verdict of guilty upon six counts of murder and one of attempted murder, with a unanimous verdict of guilty in relation to the attempted murder of Nobbs.&lt;ref name="nicholson1"&gt;{{cite news|title=The lonely murderer who preyed on young drifters|first=David|last=Nicholson|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=5 November 1983|page=3|issue=61682}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croom-Johnson sentenced Nilsen to [[life imprisonment]] with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 25 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1375716/Sir-David-Croom-Johnson.html|title=Sir David Croom-Johnson|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=25 November 2000|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
Following his conviction, Nilsen was transferred to [[HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs|Wormwood Scrubs]] prison to begin his sentence.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=240}} As a [[Prisoner security categories in the United Kingdom|Category A prisoner]], Nilsen was assigned his own cell, and could mix freely with other inmates. Nilsen did not lodge an [[appeal]], accepting that the Crown case — that he had had the capacity to control his actions and that he had killed with premeditation — was essentially correct. He further elaborated on the day of his conviction that he took an enormous thrill from the "social seduction; the getting the 'friend' back; the decision to kill; the body and its disposal".{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=244}} Nilsen also claimed drunkenness was the sole reason at least two of his attempted murders were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Masters|1985|pp=242–243}}

In December 1983, Nilsen was cut on the face and chest with a razor blade by an inmate named Albert Moffatt, resulting in injuries requiring 89 stitches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nilsen denies advances|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|location=Glasgow|date= 19 June 1984|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, he was briefly transferred to [[HM Prison Parkhurst|Parkhurst]] prison, before being transferred to [[HM Prison Wakefield|Wakefield]] prison, where he remained until 1990. In 1991, he was transferred to a vulnerable-prisoner unit at [[HM Prison Full Sutton|Full Sutton]] prison upon concerns for his safety. He remained there until 1993, when he was transferred to [[HM Prison Whitemoor|Whitemoor]] prison, again as a Category A prisoner, and with increased segregation from other inmates.

The minimum term of 25 years' to life imprisonment to which Nilsen was sentenced in 1983 was replaced by a [[whole life tariff]] by [[Home Secretary]] [[Michael Howard]] in December 1994. This ruling ensured he would never be released from prison, a punishment he accepted.{{sfn|Persaud|Masters|Wilson|Campbell|1997|p=37}}

In 2003, Nilsen was again transferred to HMP Full Sutton, where he remained incarcerated as a Category A prisoner.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=276}} In the prison workshop, Nilsen translated books into [[braille]]. He spent much of his free time reading and writing, and was allowed to paint and compose music upon a keyboard. He also exchanged letters with numerous people who sought his correspondence.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=276}} Nilsen remained at HMP Full Sutton until his death on 12 May 2018.&lt;ref name="sky2018"&gt;{{cite news |title=Serial killer Dennis Nilsen dies in prison |url=https://news.sky.com/story/serial-killer-dennis-nilsen-dies-in-prison-11369937 |accessdate=12 May 2018 |publisher=Sky News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2018"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44097196|title=Dennis Nilsen: Serial killer dies in prison aged 72|work=BBC News|date=12 May 2018|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DnilsenTV.JPG|thumb|right|Dennis Nilsen in 1992, in an interview with [[ITV Central|Central Television]] as part of the series ''Viewpoint 1993 – Murder In Mind'']]
In September 1992, [[ITV Central|Central Television]] conducted an interview with Nilsen as part of the programme ''Viewpoint 1993 – Murder In Mind'', which focused upon [[offender profiling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/law-report-decision-not-to-ban-nilsen-interview-upheld-secretary-of-state-for-the-home-department-v-central-broadcasting-ltd-and-another-chancery-division-mr-justice-aldous-and-court-of-appeal-sir-thomas-bingham-master-of-the-rolls-lord-justice-mccowan-and-lord-justice-hirst-26-january-1993-1481234.html|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=28 January 1993|title=Law Report: Decision not to ban Nilsen interview upheld|first=Paul|last=Magrath|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A four-minute section of this interview, in which Nilsen frankly discussed his crimes, was initially scheduled to be broadcast on 19 January 1993; the [[Home Office]] sought to ban the interview from being broadcast&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/nilsen-tv-interview-banned-1479541.html|work=[[The Independent]]|date=20 January 1993|location=London|title=Nilsen TV interview banned|first=Maggie|last=Brown|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that they had not granted permission for Central Television to conduct interviews with Nilsen which were later broadcast to the public, and claimed ownership of copyrighted material. Central Television challenged the Home Office ruling, citing sections of the 1988 Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, and that full permission to conduct an interview with Nilsen had been granted in advance. The decision not to ban the interview from public screening was made on 26 January 1993, and the interview was screened in full that evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Broadcasters welcome 'surprising' decision|first=Andrew|last=Culf|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=27 January 1993|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nilsen remained alert to trade union activities, and repeatedly sought legal avenues to challenge real and perceived abuses of prison rules by prison officers — regularly petitioning the Home Office and, later, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] with complaints. As a result, he was an unpopular inmate with successive governors at the various prisons in which he was incarcerated.{{sfn|Persaud|Masters|Wilson|Campbell|1997|p=37}}

In October 2001, Nilsen brought a [[judicial review]] against the prison service, citing that the homosexual [[softcore pornography]] magazines ''Vulcan'' and ''Him'', to which he subscribed regularly, had some images and articles of a more explicit nature removed before the magazine reached him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheston|first1=Paul|title=Mass killer fights for porn in jail|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/mass-killer-fights-for-porn-in-jail-6312916.html|work=[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]|location=London|date=25 October 2001|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/serial-killer-fights-to-gain-access-to-gay-pornography-632700.html | work=[[The Independent]] | title=Serial killer fights to gain access to gay pornography | first=Robert |last=Verkaik | date=26 October 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215171206/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/serial-killer-fights-to-gain-access-to-gay-pornography-632700.html|archivedate=15 December 2008|via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal case he brought against the prison service was dismissed because he could not establish that any breach of his human rights had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmpolcon/writev/1049/m2.htm|title=Human Rights Act Reporting in the Media: corrections and clarifications|first=Helen|last=Wildbore|accessdate=23 June 2015|work=HC 1049 UK Bill of Rights Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following his incarceration, Nilsen composed an unpublished, 400-page [[autobiography]], entitled ''The History of a Drowning Boy'' (the title being a reference to his concepts of the tranquillity of death following his grandfather's death and his own near-fatal drowning in 1954).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nilsen v Full Sutton Prison &amp; Anor [2004] EWCA Civ 1540|date=17 November 2004|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2004/1540.html|work=[[British and Irish Legal Information Institute|BAILII]]|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the autobiography remains in the possession of one of the people with whom Nilsen corresponded and in whom Nilsen held unquestioning trust.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=180}} In his autobiography, Nilsen stated that, beginning with his service in the army, he constantly lived two separate lives: his "real life" and his "fantasy life".{{sfn|Coffey|2013|pp=75–76}} He writes: "When I was with people, I was in the "real" world, and in my private life, I snapped instantly into my fantasy life. I could oscillate between the two with instant ease." With reference to his murders, Nilsen claimed that his emotional state upon the dates of the murders, in conjunction with the amount of alcohol he had consumed, were both core factors in his decision to kill. He further emphasised that, when feeling low, seizing an opportunity to satisfy the sexual fantasies he had developed in which the victim is the young, attractive and passive partner, and he the older active partner, temporarily relieved him of a general feeling of inadequacy.

Nilsen's first murder victim was identified in 2006 as 14-year-old Stephen Dean Holmes.&lt;ref name="cps"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cps.gov.uk/news/latest_news/172_06/|title=Dennis Nilsen — CPS decision about first victim|date=6 December 2006|work=[[Crown Prosecution Service]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327103455/http://cps.gov.uk/news/latest_news/172_06/|archivedate=27 March 2015|via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formal identification was confirmed via a combination of [[circumstantial evidence]] and by Nilsen identifying a photograph of the youth shown to him by police (all bone fragments found at Melrose Avenue had been destroyed). He was not charged with this murder as the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] decided that a prosecution would not be in the public interest, and would not contribute to his current sentence.&lt;ref name=cps/&gt;

At least four victims killed between 1980 and 1981 at Melrose Avenue remain unidentified. A [[Forensic science|forensics]] expert testified at Nilsen's 1983 trial that "at least eight bodies" had been incinerated at Melrose Avenue,{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=203}} academically confirming he had murdered at least eleven victims. Several items confiscated from Nilsen's Cranley Gardens address — some of which had been introduced as evidence at Nilsen's trial — are on display at [[Scotland Yard|New Scotland Yard]]'s [[Black Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Black Museum |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/attractions/the-black-museum|location=London|date=11 May 2009|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]|first=Peter |last=Watts|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exhibits include the stove upon which Nilsen had boiled the heads of his final three victims; the knives he had used to dissect several of his victims' bodies; the headphones Nilsen had used to strangle Ockenden; the ligature he had fashioned to strangle his last victim; and the bath from his Cranley Gardens address in which he had drowned Howlett and retained the body of Allen prior to dissection.

==Death==
On 10 May 2018, Nilsen was taken from  Full Sutton prison to [[York Hospital]] after complaining of severe stomach pains. He was found to have a ruptured abdominal [[aortic aneurysm]] which was repaired, although he subsequently suffered a [[Thrombus|blood clot]] as a complication of the surgery. Nilsen died on 12 May. A subsequent [[Autopsy|post-mortem]] examination revealed that the immediate cause of Nilsen's death was [[pulmonary embolism]] and retroperitoneal haemorrhage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yorkmix.com/serial-killer-dennis-nilsen-died-in-york-hospital-coroner-reveals/|title=Serial Killer Dennis Nilsen Died in York Hospital, Coroner Reveals|date=18 May 2018|accessdate=30 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==
Nilsen is known to have killed twelve young men and boys between 1978 and 1983; it is suspected that the true number of victims may be fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44097196|title=Dennis Nilsen: Serial killer dies in prison aged 72|publisher=BBC|date=12 May 2018|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least nine victims had been killed at 195 Melrose Avenue, with his final three victims being killed at 23 Cranley Gardens. Of Nilsen's eight identified victims, only three — Stephen Holmes, Kenneth Ockenden and Graham Allen — had a permanent address at the time of their murder, with the remaining victims largely (though not exclusively) consisting of [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]]s, [[runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s and [[male prostitute]]s.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=202}}

In 1992,{{sfn|Persaud|Masters|Wilson|Campbell|1997|p=37}} Nilsen claimed the true total of victims he killed was twelve, and that he had fabricated the three additional victims he initially confessed to having killed at Melrose Avenue,{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=208}} both in response to pressure as he was being interviewed as well as to simply "stick with the figure" of approximately fifteen victims he had provided investigators with as he was initially escorted to Hornsey police station. Nilsen said that three unidentified victims he had initially confessed to killing — an [[Irish people|Irishman]] in September 1980; a "[[hippy]]" in November or December 1980, and a skinhead in April 1981 — had been invented to simply "complement the continuity of evidence". DCI Jay dismisses Nilsen's claims to have only killed twelve victims, stating that in the more than 30 hours of interviews police had conducted with Nilsen, when discussing the fifteen victims he had initially confessed to killing, he had never provided any inconsistencies in the physical characteristics, the date or place of encounter, the act of murder, or the ritual he observed with the body of any of the fifteen victims.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=208}}

===1978===
*'''30 December''': Stephen Dean Holmes, 14. Last seen on his way home from a rock concert; Holmes encountered Nilsen in the Cricklewood Arms on the evening of 29 December before accepting an offer to drink alcohol with him at Melrose Avenue. The following morning, Nilsen strangled Holmes with a necktie until he was unconscious, before drowning him in a bucket of water. His body was to remain beneath Nilsen's floorboards for over seven months before being disposed of upon a bonfire, and Holmes was the only victim not to have been dissected before disposal. Holmes' remains were identified in November 2006.&lt;ref name=cps /&gt;

===1979===
* '''3 December''': Kenneth Ockenden, 23. A Canadian student on a tour of Britain; Ockenden encountered Nilsen in a pub on 3 December 1979. He was escorted on a tour of London, before agreeing to accompany Nilsen to his flat for a meal and further drinks. One of the few murder victims who was widely reported as a [[missing person]], Ockenden was strangled with the cord of Nilsen's headphones as he listened to a record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0lobBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT47|title=Bodies in the Back Garden – True Stories of Brutal Murders Close to Home|first1=Cawthorne|last1=Nigel|first2=Nigel|last2=Cawthorne|date=7 August 2014|publisher=John Blake Publishing|accessdate=13 May 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781784181796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980===
* '''17 May''': Martyn Duffey, 16. Duffey was a 16-year-old runaway from Birkenhead. On 17 May 1980,{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=196}} Nilsen encountered the youth at a London railway station as he himself returned from a union conference in Southport. Nilsen strangled Duffey and subsequently drowned him in the kitchen sink&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramsland |first=Katherine |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/nilsen/garden_2.html |title=A Taste for Death|work=[[truTV]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929094921/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/nilsen/garden_2.html|archivedate=29 September 2012 |via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; before bathing with the body. Two days later, Duffey's body was placed beneath the floorboards.
* '''[[circa|c]]. 20 August''': William Sutherland, 26. A 26-year-old father-of-one originally from [[Edinburgh]], who occasionally worked as a male prostitute. Sutherland met Nilsen in a pub near [[Piccadilly Circus]] in August 1980. Nilsen could not recall precisely how he had murdered Sutherland, other than that he had strangled Sutherland as he himself stood or knelt in front of this victim and, in the morning, there was "another dead body".
* '''September''': Unidentified. All that Nilsen could remember about his fifth victim was that he was an Irish labourer with rough hands, who wore an old suit and jacket, and whose age he estimated to be between 27 and 30 years old. He had met this victim in the Cricklewood Arms in late 1980.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=123}} Nilsen later claimed to have fabricated this victim.
* '''October''': Unidentified. Nilsen's sixth victim was described by his murderer as a slender male prostitute, approximately 5&amp;nbsp;ft. 10 in height, who was aged between 20 and 30, and of either [[Filipino people|Filipino]] or [[Mexican people|Mexican]] descent. To Nilsen, this victim had [[Gypsy (term)|gypsy]]-like features. Nilsen met this victim in the Salisbury Arms in October 1980.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=146}}
* '''November''': Unidentified. This victim was described by Nilsen as being an English vagrant in his 20s, whom he encountered sleeping in a doorway at the top of Charing Cross Road. He was emaciated, with a pale complexion and had several missing teeth. Nilsen and the youth took a taxi to Melrose Avenue; that evening, the victim was strangled to death as he slept, with his legs moving in a cycling motion as he was strangled. Nilsen later stated he believed this victim's life had been "one of long suffering",{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=209}} and that the act of killing this victim had been "as easy as taking candy from a baby".{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=141}}
* '''November–December''': Unidentified. The last victim to be killed by Nilsen in 1980 was an English "long-haired hippy", aged between 25 and 30, whom he had met in the [[West End (London)|West End]] after the pubs had closed in November or December 1980. This victim's body was retained beneath the floorboards of the flat until Nilsen removed the corpse, cut it into three pieces, then replaced the dissected remains beneath the floorboards. He burned the corpse one year later. Nilsen later claimed to have fabricated this victim.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|pp=209-210}}

===1981===
* '''c. 4 January''': Unidentified. The ninth victim was described by Nilsen as an "18-year-old, blue-eyed Scot" who wore a green tracksuit top and trainers. Nilsen met this victim in the Golden Lion pub in Soho in early January 1981. Killed after partaking in a drinking contest with Nilsen at Melrose Avenue, the body of this victim was dissected on 12 January.{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=198}}
* '''February''': Unidentified. Murdered sometime in February 1981. Nilsen recalled little about this victim, other than the fact he was originally from Belfast; was slim, approximately 5{{nbsp}}ft.{{nbsp}}9{{nbsp}}in. tall; and was aged in his early 20s. He had encountered this victim somewhere in the West End after the pubs had closed. He was strangled with a necktie and his body subsequently placed beneath the floorboards.{{sfn|Waddell|1993|p=198}}
* '''April''': Unidentified. Nilsen encountered his eleventh victim, a muscular young English skinhead aged approximately 20, at a food stall in Leicester Square in April 1981. He was lured to Nilsen's home with the promise of a meal and alcohol. Nilsen recalled this victim had a [[tattoo]] around his neck, simply reading "cut here", and that he had boasted about how tough he was and how he liked to fight. Nilsen hung this victim's naked torso in his bedroom for 24 hours, before placing the body beneath the floorboards. Nilsen later claimed to have fabricated this victim.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=210}}
* '''18 September''': Malcolm Barlow, 23. The final victim to be murdered at Melrose Avenue, Barlow was an epileptic orphan who had spent much of his life in care homes. He was murdered after returning to Nilsen's home to thank him for having ensured he received medical attention the previous day. Prior to dissection, Barlow's body was stowed in a kitchen cupboard as Nilsen had no further room beneath his floorboards by this time.{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=144}}

===1982===
* '''March''': John Howlett, 23. Originally from [[High Wycombe]],{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=224}} Howlett was the first victim to be murdered at Cranley Gardens.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=126}} He was strangled as he slept in Nilsen's bed, with Nilsen shouting, "It's about time you went"{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=127}} as Howlett awoke to find himself being strangled. Eventually, Nilsen drowned Howlett by holding his head under water in a bathtub for five minutes. Nilsen subsequently dismembered Howlett's body, flushed portions of flesh and internal organs down the toilet, and placed various "large bones out with the rubbish".{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=204}}
* '''September''': Graham Allen, 27. Allen was a 27-year-old father-of-one, originally from [[Motherwell]], whom Nilsen encountered in Shaftesbury Avenue as Allen attempted to hail a taxi in September 1982.{{sfn|Coffey|2013|p=229}} Allen was strangled with a ligature as he sat eating an omelette Nilsen had cooked for him. His body was identified from dental records and healed [[Bone fracture|fractures]] to his jawbone. Dissected portions of flesh and small bones from the body of Allen subsequently blocked the drains at Cranley Gardens.

===1983===
* '''26 January''': Stephen Sinclair, 20. Nilsen's final victim. Sinclair was originally from [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]; at the time he encountered Nilsen, he was a [[heroin]] addict who suffered from the habit of [[self-harm]]ing.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=129}} Nilsen encountered Sinclair in [[Oxford Street]], where he first bought the youth a hamburger before suggesting that Sinclair accompany him to Cranley Gardens. After Sinclair had consumed alcohol and injected heroin at Nilsen's flat, Nilsen strangled him to death with a ligature. The head, upper torso and arms of Sinclair were stowed in the tea chest in Nilsen's living room; Sinclair's lower torso and legs were stowed beneath Nilsen's bathtub.{{sfn|Masters|1985|p=18}}

'''Dennis Lynn Rader''' (born March 9, 1945) is an American [[serial killer]] known as '''BTK''' or the '''BTK Strangler'''. Rader gave himself the name "BTK" (for "bind, torture, kill").

Between 1974 and 1991, Rader killed ten people in the [[Wichita, Kansas]] metro area.

Rader sent taunting letters to police and newspapers describing the details of his crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BbsJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA353 |title=Criminology: Theories, Patterns, and Typologies |last=Siegel |first=Larry |date=January 19, 2012 |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] | location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-133-71052-3 |page=353 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728001507/http://books.google.com/books?id=BbsJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA353 |archive-date=July 28, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBkEGAOlCDsC&amp;pg=PR17 |title=Secret History: The Story of Cryptology |last=Bauer |first=Craig P. |date=March 25, 2013 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] | location=Boca Raton, Florida| isbn=978-1-4665-6186-1 |page=17 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727084825/http://books.google.com/books?id=EBkEGAOlCDsC&amp;pg=PR17 |archive-date=July 27, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ob0KAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA254 |title=Serial Murderers and Their Victims |last=Hickey |first=Eric W. |date=2012 |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-285-40168-3 |page=254 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720155542/http://books.google.com/books?id=Ob0KAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA254 |archive-date=July 20, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a decade-long hiatus, Rader resumed sending letters in 2004, leading to his 2005 arrest and subsequent guilty plea.

Their bodies were discovered by the family's eldest child, Charlie Otero, who was in 10th grade at the time, as he returned home from school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After his 2005 arrest, Rader confessed to killing the Otero family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/06/27/rader.transcript/ |title=CNN.com – BTK: 'I took her to the basement and...hung her' – Jun 27, 2005 |website=[[CNN]]|access-date=July 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707195931/http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/06/27/rader.transcript/ |archive-date=July 7, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rader wrote a letter that had been stashed inside an engineering book in the [[Wichita Public Library]] in October 1974, which described in detail the killing of the Otero family in January of that year.&lt;ref name="McClellan" /&gt;

In early 1978, he sent another letter to television station [[KAKE (TV)|KAKE]] in Wichita, claiming responsibility for the murders of the Oteros, Kathryn Bright, Shirley Vian and Nancy Fox.&lt;ref name="McClellan" /&gt; He suggested many possible names for himself, including the one that stuck: BTK.

He also intended to kill others, such as Anna Williams, who in 1979, aged 63, escaped death by returning home much later than expected. Rader explained during his confession that he became obsessed with Williams and was "absolutely livid" when she evaded him. He spent hours waiting at her home, but became impatient and left when she did not return home from visiting friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/unsolved/btk/13.html |title=The BTK Story&amp;nbsp;– More Clues Revealed |first1=Marilyn |last1=Bardsley |first2=Rachael |last2=Bell |first3=David |last3=Lohr |website=[[Crime Library]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529005912/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/unsolved/btk/13.html |archivedate=May 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine Hedge, aged 53, was found on May 5, 1985, at East 53rd Street North between North Webb Road and North Greenwich Road in Wichita. Rader had killed her on April 27, 1985, and he took her dead body to his church, the Christ Lutheran Church, where he was the president of the church council. There, he photographed her body in various bondage positions. Rader had previously stored black plastic sheets and other materials at the church in preparation for the murder and then later dumped the body in a remote ditch. He had called his plan "Project Cookie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/08/18/btk.killings.wed/ |title=BTK took body to church, says investigator |website=[[CNN]] | publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia |date=August 18, 2005 |accessdate=February 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802163531/http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/08/18/btk.killings.wed/ |archive-date=August 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, after the murders of three members of the Fager family in Wichita, a letter was received from someone claiming to be the BTK killer, in which the author of the letter denied being the perpetrator of the Fager murders. The author credited the killer with having done "admirable work." It was not proven until 2005 that this letter was, in fact, written by Rader. He is not considered by police to have committed this crime.&lt;ref name="douglas2007" /&gt; Additionally, two of the women Rader had [[stalked]] in the 1980s and one he had stalked in the mid-1990s filed [[restraining order]]s against him; one of them also moved away.&lt;ref name="a&amp;e"&gt;A&amp;E Documentary Special{{snds}}The BTK Killer Speaks&lt;/ref&gt;

His final victim, Dolores E. Davis, was found on February 1, 1991, at West 117th Street North and North Meridian Street in Park City. Rader killed her on January 19, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Geberth |first=Vernon |title=Sex-Related Homicide and Death Investigation: Practical and Clinical Perspectives |publisher=[[CRC Press]]|location=Boca Raton.

=== Cold case ===
By 2004, the investigation of the BTK Killer was considered a [[cold case]]. Then, Rader began a series of 11 communications to the local media that led directly to his arrest in February 2005. In March 2004, ''[[The Wichita Eagle]]'' received a letter from someone using the return address '''Bill Thomas Killman'''. The author of the letter claimed that he had murdered Vicki Wegerle on September 16, 1986, and enclosed photographs of the crime scene and a photocopy of her [[driver's license]], which had been stolen at the time of the crime.&lt;ref name="vic"&gt;{{cite news |title=BTK Strangler resurfaces after 25 years |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/btk-strangler-resurfaces-after-25-years-1-519136 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |work=[[The Scotsman]] | date=March 28, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714151807/http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/btk-strangler-resurfaces-after-25-years-1-519136 |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2004, television station KAKE in Wichita received a letter with chapter headings for the "BTK Story," fake IDs, and a word puzzle.&lt;ref name="media.kansas.com" /&gt; On June 9, 2004, a package was found taped to a stop sign at the corner of First and Kansas in Wichita. It had graphic descriptions of the Otero murders and a sketch labeled "The Sexual Thrill Is My Bill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singular |first=Stephen |title=Unholy Messenger: The Life and Crimes of the BTK Serial Killer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOtccTWu3FYC&amp;pg=PA115 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |date=March 27, 2007 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | isbn=978-1-4165-3154-8 |pages=115–116 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724185808/http://books.google.com/books?id=BOtccTWu3FYC&amp;pg=PA115 |archive-date=July 24, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also enclosed was a chapter list for a proposed book titled ''The BTK Story'', which mimicked a story written in 1999 by [[truTV|Court TV]] crime writer [[David Lohr]]. Chapter One was titled "A Serial Killer Is Born." In July, a package was dropped into the return slot at the downtown public library containing more bizarre material, including the claim that he was responsible for the death of 19-year-old Jake Allen in [[Argonia, Kansas]], earlier that month. This claim was false, and the death was ruled a suicide.&lt;ref name="31 Years"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Potter |first1=Tim |title=After 31 years and 10 deaths pieces fall in place |url=http://www.kansas.com/news/special-reports/btk/article1003747.html |accessdate=January 21, 2015 |work=[[The Wichita Eagle]] |date=July 10, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229201313/http://www.kansas.com/news/special-reports/btk/article1003747.html |archive-date=December 29, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his capture, Rader admitted in his interrogation that he had been planning to kill again and he had set a date, October 2004, and was stalking his intended victim.&lt;ref name="a&amp;e" /&gt; In October 2004, a manila envelope was dropped into a [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] box in Wichita. It had many cards with images of terror and bondage of children pasted on them, a poem threatening the life of lead investigator Lt. Ken Landwehr, and a false autobiography with many details about Rader's life. These details were later released to the public.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In December 2004, Wichita police received another package from the BTK killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Girard |first=James E. |title=Criminalistics: Forensic Science, Crime, and Terrorism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXJHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA417 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |date=2013 |publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers]] | isbn=978-1-4496-9180-6 |page=417 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718025951/http://books.google.com/books?id=EXJHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA417 |archive-date=July 18, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; This time, the package was found in Wichita's Murdock Park. It had the driver's license of Nancy Fox, which was noted as stolen from the crime scene, as well as a doll that was symbolically bound at the hands and feet, and had a plastic bag tied over its head.&lt;ref name="31 Years" /&gt;

In January 2005, Rader attempted to leave a cereal box in the bed of a pickup truck at a [[Home Depot]] in Wichita, but the box was discarded by the truck's owner. It was later retrieved from the trash after Rader asked what had become of it in a later message. Surveillance tape of the parking lot from that date revealed a distant figure driving a black [[Jeep Cherokee]] leaving the box in the pickup. In February, more postcards were sent to KAKE, and another cereal box left at a rural location was found to contain another bound doll, apparently meant to symbolize the murder of 11-year-old Josephine Otero.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In his letters to police, Rader asked if his writings, if put on a [[floppy disk]], could be traced or not. The police answered his question in a newspaper ad posted in the ''Wichita Eagle'' saying it would be safe to use the disk. On February 16, 2005, Rader sent a purple 1.44-Megabyte [[Memorex]] floppy disk to [[Fox Network|Fox TV]] affiliate [[KSAS-TV]] in Wichita.&lt;ref name="probe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="campnovel" /&gt; Also enclosed were a letter, a gold-colored necklace with a large medallion, and a photocopy of the cover of ''[[John Sandford (novelist)#Prey series|Rules of Prey]]'', a 1989 novel about a serial killer.&lt;ref name="campnovel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johnsandford.org/articles050303.html |title=Camp novel crops up in the BTK case |date=March 3, 2005 |publisher=johnsandford.org, attributed to "StarTribune" |accessdate=June 2, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509092637/http://www.johnsandford.org/articles050303.html |archive-date=May 9, 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Rader's August 18 sentencing, victims' families made statements, after which Rader apologized in a rambling 30-minute monologue that the prosecutor likened to an [[Academy Awards]] acceptance speech.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt; His statement has been described as an example of an often-observed phenomenon among [[psychopath]]s: their inability to understand the emotional content of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=For most people, emotional words and scenes lead to heightened activity in the [[amygdala]] as the emotional sense of the situation overcomes them, often shutting down higher functions. For psychopaths, the amygdala responds less powerfully to the same items and when it does respond it does so in step with higher cortical activity. The cortex is the brain area associated with rational thought and interpretive functions. So, psychopaths presented with an emotional stimulus have to think about its meaning and rationally make sense of it in order to parse their response. They do not feel the effects of others' fear, sadness, or pain, so they have to work to interpret their environment.&lt;br /&gt;This characteristic appears clearly in the [[allocution]] of Dennis Rader, the BTK Killer. Standing in court before the judge, the victims' families, and the assembled press, Rader listened as the judge read out the details of his offenses. Without blinking an eye, Rader stopped the judge at several junctures to correct some minor detail. Unmoved by the enormity of his crimes or the responses of the people gathered there, Rader makes almost casual responses to the facts in the case; at one point making mouth noises as he sought a precise fact.

Rader talked about innocuous topics such as the weather during the 40-minute drive to El Dorado, but began to cry when the victims' families' statements from the court proceedings came on the radio.

Beginning in 2006, he was allowed access to television and radio, to read magazines, and other privileges for good behavior.&lt;ref name="kdoc0083707" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lloyd |last=Vries |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/24/national/main1535408.shtml |title=BTK Killer Gets Extra Jail Perks |publisher=[[CBS News]] | date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=March 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025232613/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/24/national/main1535408.shtml |archive-date=October 25, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further investigations ===
Following Rader's arrest, police in Wichita, Park City and several surrounding cities looked into unsolved cases with the cooperation of the state police and the FBI. They particularly focused on cases after 1994, when the death penalty was reinstated in Kansas. Police in surrounding states such as Nebraska, Missouri, Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas also investigated cold cases that fit Rader's pattern to some extent. The [[FBI]], and local jurisdictions at Rader's former duty stations checked into unsolved cases during Rader's time in the service.

After exhaustive investigations, none of these agencies discovered any further murders attributable to Rader, confirming early suspicions that Rader would have taken credit for any additional murders that he had committed. The ten known murders are now believed to be the only murders for which Rader is actually responsible, although Wichita police are fairly certain that Rader stalked and researched a number of other potential victims. This includes one person who was saved when Rader called off his planned attack upon his arrival near the target's home due to the presence of construction and road crews nearby. Rader stated in his police interview that "there are a lot of lucky people," meaning that he had thought about and developed various levels of murder plans for other victims.&lt;ref name="InsideStory" /&gt;

=== Evaluation by Robert Mendoza ===
Massachusetts psychologist Robert Mendoza was hired by Rader's court-appointed public defenders to conduct a psychological evaluation of Rader, and determine if an insanity-based defense might be viable. He conducted an interview after Rader pleaded guilty on June 27, 2005. Mendoza diagnosed Rader with [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] and [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]]s: He observed that Rader has a grandiose sense of self, a belief that he is “special” and therefore entitled to special treatment; a pathological need for attention and admiration; a preoccupation with maintaining rigid order and structure; and a complete lack of empathy for his victims.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsland, pg. 217-18&lt;/ref&gt;

NBC claimed Rader knew the interview might be televised, but this was false according to the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office. Rader mentioned the interview during his sentencing statement. On October 25, 2005, the Kansas attorney general filed a petition to sue Mendoza and Tali Waters, co-owners of Cambridge Forensic Consultants, LLC, for breach of contract, claiming that they intended to benefit financially from the use of information obtained through involvement in Rader's defense. On May 10, 2007, Mendoza [[settlement (litigation)|settled]] the case for US$30,000 with no admission of wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BTK Psychologist to Pay State |url=http://www.wibw.com/home/headlines/7446541.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] | website=WIBW |date=May 10, 2007 |accessdate=February 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211065249/http://www.wibw.com/home/headlines/7446541.html |archive-date=February 11, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic psychologist [[Katherine Ramsland]] wrote ''Confession of a Serial Killer'' about Rader, compiled from her five-year correspondence with him. In the introduction, she describes the book as a "guided autobiography" of Rader, stating that she interjects only to "assist with chronology or provide substance, sense, or background."&lt;ref name="Ramsland"&gt;Ramsland, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The horror writer [[Stephen King]] says his novella ''[[A Good Marriage]]'', and the [[A Good Marriage (film)|film based on it]], was inspired by the BTK killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roy |last=Wenzl |title=Daughter of Wichita serial killer BTK: Stephen King 'exploiting my father's 10 victims' |url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/state/kansas/article2254570.html |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |publisher=[[McClatchy]]| location=Kansas City, Missouri |date=September 26, 2014 |accessdate=March 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317065442/http://www.kansascity.com/news/state/kansas/article2254570.html |archive-date=March 17, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novelist [[Thomas Harris]] has said that the character of [[Francis Dolarhyde]] from his 1981 novel ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'' is partially based on the then-unidentified BTK Killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beattie |first1=Robert |title=Nightmare in Wichita |date=2005 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-451-21738-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/nightmareinwichi0000beat }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 made-for-TV movie, ''[[The Hunt for the BTK Killer]]'', told the story from the perspective of the Wichita detectives who worked the case for 31 years.

Rader is a character in the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Mindhunter (TV series)|Mindhunter]]''. He appears throughout season one and season two, in vignettes set in and around [[Park City, Kansas]].

The "[[Cold Case Files]]" podcast covered the story of the murders and eventual solving of the cold case that led to Rader's arrest in their December 5, 2017 episode called "Finding BTK."

The 2018 film ''[[The Clovehitch Killer]]'' is loosely based on Rader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Gregory|last=Wakeman|url=https://www.metro.us/entertainment/movies/is-the-clovehitch-killer-based-on-real-events |title=Is 'The Clovehitch Killer' based on real events? |website=[[Metro (British newspaper)|metro.us]]|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|location=London, England|date=November 13, 2018|access-date=January 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108045809/https://www.metro.us/entertainment/movies/is-the-clovehitch-killer-based-on-real-events |archive-date=January 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diane Michelle Zamora''' (born January 21, 1978) is a former [[United States Naval Academy]] [[midshipman]] and convicted [[murder]]er. On December 4, 1995, Zamora and her ex-fiancé, '''David Graham''', murdered Adrianne Jessica Jones, who Zamora believed was a romantic rival for Graham; he had claimed that he had given her a ride home and had sex with her one month earlier. Enraged, Zamora asked Graham to kill Jones. In the early morning of December 4, Graham picked up Jones in Zamora's car, while she hid in the hatchback. They went to a remote location and got into a struggle. Zamora hit Jones over the head with weights, and Graham shot her twice after she broke away from them.

Following the murder, Graham was at the [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]], while Zamora was at the Naval Academy in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], [[Maryland]]. Zamora confessed the crime to her roommates, which ultimately led to notification of the local police in Texas. Both Zamora and Graham were arrested on September 6, 1996. There were separate trials, which resulted in guilty verdicts. Zamora and Graham are serving [[life imprisonment|life sentences]] for the murder. Zamora's attorney filed an [[appeal]] in 2005, stating that [[prosecution]] withheld the information that Graham did not give Jones a ride after the meet, and probably did not have sex with Jones.

==Murder of Adrianne Jones==

=== Background ===
Diane Zamora and David Graham met at a [[Civil Air Patrol]] meeting at Spinks Airport, near [[Crowley, Texas|Crowley]], [[Texas]], when they were 14-year-olds. Zamora said she wanted to be an [[astronaut]] and Graham wanted to be a pilot. They began dating about four years later in August 1995, when they were both high school [[honor student]]s.&lt;ref name="DO Love is a killer" /&gt; Zamora was a student at [[Crowley High School (Texas)|Crowley High School]], and Graham was a student at [[Mansfield High School (Mansfield, Texas)|Mansfield High School]].&lt;ref name="CL Beneath" /&gt; About a month after they began dating, Zamora and Graham announced their engagement to their families. They planned to marry after their college graduations.&lt;ref name="DO Love is a killer" /&gt;

Graham went to school with Adrianne Jones, who was on the cross-country track team with him. Jones, whose nickname was A.J., was also an honor student. She had plans to attend [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and was interested in becoming a [[behavioral analysis|behavioral analyst]]. Her family included her mother Linda;&lt;ref name="DO Love is a killer" /&gt; her father Bill and two brothers.&lt;ref name="ARN found guilty" /&gt; Graham claimed that on November 4 he had given Jones a ride home from a regional meet and that during the ride he stopped the car and they had sex.&lt;ref name="DO Love is a killer" /&gt; During her confession to police, Zamora said that she believed it was this night when Graham came over to her house, carrying a stuffed animal and having "this look in his eyes that was horrible, he looked so scared."&lt;ref name="NBC Zamora confession" /&gt;

In Zamora's [[confession]], she said that about a month later she questioned Graham about other girls, including Jones. They got into a fight when he pressed her to study for the [[SAT Subject Tests|SAT]]. Graham then said that he had not had sex only with her, but also had sex with Jones. Zamora began screaming and hitting her head against the floor, shouting, "Kill her, kill her." She said that beginning December 2, they tried to get in touch with Jones and Graham continually tried to calm Zamora down.&lt;ref name="NBC Zamora confession" /&gt; Graham said in 2008 that Zamora told him that she would kill herself or leave him if he did not kill Jones.&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt;

Although they were goal-driven and intelligent, Zamora{{efn||name="Zamora beneath"}} and Graham{{efn|name="Graham beneath"}} each had issues "beneath the surface" that were reflected at times in their behavior. [[truTV|Court TV]] said that, "from a surface view, no one would have expected that Diane and David would become a lethal combination. Although they both continued to advance in the military, their single-minded quests for recognition covered up deep-rooted problems leading to obsession and murder."&lt;ref name="CL Beneath" /&gt;

=== The crime ===
[[File:Joe pool lake lynn creek park 1.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Pool Lake]], [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas]], [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant]] and [[Ellis County, Texas|Ellis Counties]], Texas]]
According to Graham, he and Zamora planned to kill Jones and put her in a lake with weights tied to her body. He called Jones on the night of December 3, 1995, and arranged to drive her to [[Joe Pool Lake]] while Zamora hid in the hatchback of&lt;ref name="DO Love is a killer" /&gt; her car. Zamora said in her confession that they arrived at a spot by the lake after 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on December 4. She said that when Graham stopped the car she came out from the hatchback and asked Jones if she had sex with Graham. She claimed Jones said that she had, but hadn't enjoyed it because she felt guilty. Zamora became enraged.&lt;ref name="NBC Zamora confession" /&gt; Zamora and Graham both said in their confessions that they got into a struggle, Zamora hit Jones on the head with the weights, and Jones fought back. She got out of the car and ran into a field. Graham shot her twice with a 9mm handgun after she fell down.&lt;ref name="DO Love is a killer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC Zamora confession" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt; According to Zamora's confession, when he returned to the car, Graham said, "I love you, baby, do you believe me now?"&lt;ref name="NBC Zamora confession" /&gt; Shortly thereafter, Zamora asked what they had just done, to which David answered, "I don't know. I can't believe we just did that."&lt;ref name="NBC Zamora confession" /&gt; They cleaned up&lt;ref name="NBC Zamora confession" /&gt; and/or disposed of their bloody clothes and went home.&lt;ref name="DO Love is a killer" /&gt; Zamora and Graham each said that she then cleaned  her car that had blood in it, and that at that time Graham was vomiting.&lt;ref name="DO Love is a killer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC Zamora confession" /&gt; She wrote in her calendar for the day, "Adrianne 1:38 a.m."&lt;ref name="ARN mother testifies" /&gt;

=== The investigation and arrest===
Jones' body was found in an open field on Seeton Road, near Joe Pool Lake, on December 4.&lt;ref name="DO Love is a killer" /&gt; She was brought in to the medical examiner as a Jane Doe. It did not appear that she had been sexually assaulted, but it was clear that she had been shot and had "blunt traumatic head injury". The shooter had stood within a few feet of Jones when pulling the trigger. The second bullet was fired when the killer stood right over her, hitting her right between the eyes. Her body was positively identified to be the missing Adrianne Jones when the medical examiner received a photograph of Jones.&lt;ref name="CL A positive ID" /&gt;

After the murder Graham went to the [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]] in Colorado Springs and Zamora went to the [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]] in Annapolis, Maryland. While there she confessed to the murder to her two roommates, who contacted the authorities at the academy.&lt;ref name="DO Love is a killer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ARN mother testifies" /&gt; The Grand Prairie police were then contacted, and Zamora and Graham were arrested for capital murder on September 6, 1996. They were held in the [[Tarrant County Corrections Center|Tarrant County Jail]].&lt;ref name="DO Love is a killer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN Former cadet gets life" /&gt;

Graham was interrogated for 30 hours, during which he confessed to killing Jones.&lt;ref name="DO Love is a killer" /&gt; Zamora also confessed to the murder during her interrogation by the police.&lt;ref name="ARN mother testifies" /&gt; The key details of the event were similar; each said that Jones was killed because Graham had sex with her, she was taken to a remote lake, and she was hit over the head by Zamora and shot twice by Graham.&lt;ref name="ARN found guilty" /&gt;

Both later recanted their confessions.&lt;ref name="ARN mother testifies" /&gt; Graham said that he was not guilty of killing Jones, but helped cover up the murder, which he claimed Zamora committed by herself. Zamora claimed that Graham committed the murder by himself.&lt;ref name="ARN mother testifies" /&gt; A 9mm handgun, alleged to be the murder weapon, was found in the attic, which could be reached through David Graham's bedroom.&lt;ref name="ARN mother testifies" /&gt;

The police had investigated the case for nine months.&lt;ref name="CNN Former cadet gets life" /&gt; Law enforcement officials associated with the case have stated that the sexual encounter between Graham and Jones did not happen, but was invented by Graham. Sgt. Alan Patton of the Grand Prairie Police Department stated: "For those who don't remember, this was a totally brutal, unnecessary murder. David had lied to Diane about an alleged sexual tryst that never happened with Adrianne Jones. If he had said, 'I was just kidding, I was just trying to make you jealous', Adrianne Jones would still be alive today." However, Graham has since admitted that his original confession was accurate and the only reason he lied about the sexual encounter not happening was because of his defense lawyer's advice.&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abshire" /&gt;

=== The trial ===
Zamora's two-week trial began in February 1998 in Fort Worth with Judge Joe Drago presiding.&lt;ref name="ARN found guilty" /&gt; Linda Jones, Adrianne's mother, asked that the death penalty be removed as a sentencing option from both trials.&lt;ref name="CNN Five murders" /&gt;

During the trial, Zamora admitted to being at the scene of the crime, but denied participating in the killing of Jones. The Naval Academy Midshipmen to whom Zamora confessed and another witness stated that she showed no remorse over Jones' death.&lt;ref name="ARN found guilty" /&gt;

The case received national media attention, providing [[Court TV]] with some of its highest ratings ever in its film coverage of the trial. Some of the interest centered on whether Zamora was the submissive victim or the jealous driving force behind the murder. Under Texas law, murder is the intentional killing of another human being, while capital murder includes murder with an underlying felony of kidnapping, robbery, aggravated sexual assault, arson, or obstruction. In this case, the prosecutor believed that Jones was deceptively lured from her home by Graham asking her for a bogus date, or she would not have been in the car. Moreover, the couple committed obstruction when Zamora allegedly ordered Graham to stalk Jones into the field and to shoot her so that she could not tell the authorities.

The jury was asked to deliberate on the charges of capital murder or the lesser charges of assault, kidnapping, or false imprisonment. On February 17, 1998, after more than six hours of deliberations over two days, the jury found Zamora guilty of capital murder in the death of Adrianne Jones. Because of the Jones family's request that prosecutors not seek the death penalty against her, Zamora received a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment and would be eligible for parole after 40 years.&lt;ref name="ARN found guilty" /&gt;

On July 24, 1998, after a separate trial, a jury found Graham guilty of capital murder.&lt;ref name="CNN Former cadet gets life" /&gt; During the trial, Wendy Bartlett, also on the track team, and Coach Lee Ann Burke stated that Bartlett was the one who drove Jones home after the meet on November 4, and that Graham had left earlier, leaving Jones and Bartlett to put away equipment from the meet.&lt;ref name="LAJ Prosecutors withheld" /&gt; Graham did not drive Jones home on the night he claimed to have had sex with her, lending credence to his later recantation.  However, he ultimately repudiated his recantation, saying his lawyer had pressured him to lie, and again claimed to have had sex with Jones.  Adding that to Zamora's story about Jones admitting to having had sex with Graham when Zamora asked her about it just before the murder, it might be that Graham and Jones had sex at some other time.&lt;ref name="CL David's trial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN Five murders" /&gt; He was sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="CNN Former cadet gets life" /&gt;

David Richards, Zamora's attorney, used the testimony from Bartlett and Burke as the basis of an appeal for Zamora. The petition, made in 2005, stated that the prosecution withheld this information during Zamora's trial. "From these witnesses, the state knew, and should have known, that the testimony it sponsored in support of a sexual encounter between Jones and Graham was probably false."&lt;ref name="LAJ Prosecutors withheld" /&gt;

Due to the prominence of the case, in 2015 Tarrant County, authorities chose to keep the paper court documents of the case as historical documents even though they have been digitized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tinsley, Anna M.|url=https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/community/fort-worth/article16098065.html|title=Tarrant County's 'famous' case file won't be destroyed |newspaper=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|date=2015-03-23|accessdate=2019-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incarceration ===
[[File:Entrance to TDCJ Mountain View Unit.jpg|thumb|[[Mountain View Unit]], Gatesville, Texas, where Zamora was imprisoned]]
Zamora was transferred from a jail in Fort Worth, Texas to the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]]. She was initially held in a state prison diagnostic unit in [[Gatesville, Texas]] in February 1998.&lt;ref name="UPI transferred" /&gt; She then was held at the [[Dr. Lane Murray Unit|Murray Unit]].&lt;ref name="CL Epilogue" /&gt; At one point she was held in protective custody at [[Mountain View Unit]] in Gatesville,  She was later moved to the general prison population in the [[William P. Hobby Unit]] near [[Marlin, Texas|Marlin]]. {{Asof|2018}} she is back in protective custody in Mountain View. Zamora, opposed to her placement, filed a civil rights complaint with the [[5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]], but the complaint was dismissed.&lt;ref name=Boydcadetkiller&gt;{{cite news|author=Boyd, Deanna|url=https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/community/fort-worth/article215445360.html|title=Texas killer cadet Diane Zamora was unhappy with her housing.

Graham was held at the [[Ellis Unit]] near [[Huntsville, Texas|Huntsville]] after the trial.&lt;ref name="ST famous crime" /&gt; In 2016 he was held at the [[Darrington Unit]] near [[Rosharon, Texas|Rosharon]].&lt;ref name="TDCJ Graham" /&gt; {{Asof|2018}} he is held at the [[Allred Unit]] in [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]].&lt;ref name=Boydcadetkiller/&gt; He is currently enrolled at the Southwest Baptist Theological Seminary's inmate seminary in order to become a pastor behind bars.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} In 2008, Graham said that his confession to the police was correct and expressed remorse for killing Jones. He also said that if he had it to do over again he would have pleaded guilty to murder.&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt;

== Marriage ==
Zamora got to know Steven Mora, a fellow Texas inmate, through the mail. He had committed auto theft and burglary and was in prison for threatening someone related to one of his cases. Although they never met in person, the two decided to get married and petitioned [[Bexar County, Texas|Bexar County]] for a marriage license in 2003.&lt;ref name="Houston Chronicle" /&gt; A wedding ceremony was performed on June 17, 2003. Zamora's mother and a male friend stood in for the imprisoned couple in the county's first [[proxy marriage]], which was performed by a judge in San Antonio.&lt;ref name="shrock" /&gt; They were divorced in or around 2008.&lt;ref name="CNN Five murders" /&gt;

== 2007 interview ==
Zamora was interviewed by Stone Phillips on ''[[Dateline]]'' in a show broadcast in April 2007. Her appeals were exhausted, and with her lawyer's permission she took a [[polygraph]] test administered by ''Dateline''. Her new story was that Graham and she had been breaking up, and that Graham was using the murder to "tie her to him". She noted that she obstructed justice by cleaning the car afterwards and was an accessory after the fact; however, Zamora pointed out that the jury had convicted her of intending to kill Jones, which she denied. When she took the polygraph, the administrator repeatedly told her to stop her exaggerated breathing, a counter-measure for such tests. He said that he believed he had enough to actually say that Zamora had failed the crucial question on whether she had intended to kill Jones. Two other independent polygraph administrators, who were not at the test, were contacted by ''Dateline'' and asked to review the results; they said that they could offer no opinion due to [[Polygraph#Countermeasures|counter-measures]]. Zamora responded to Phillips that she was nervous and hyperventilating despite being told all the questions in advance and reviewing them with the administrator before the test.&lt;ref name="NBC I'm not" /&gt;

== Popular culture ==
* In 1996, Ellise Pierce of the ''Dallas Observer'' wrote that the crime "has become part of Mansfield teen folklore; kids obsess about the details of the crime as if they were unraveling a plot from ''The X-Files''."&lt;ref name="DO Love is a killer" /&gt;
* Before Zamora's trial began, the case was the subject of a 1997 made-for-television movie called ''[[Love's Deadly Triangle: The Texas Cadet Murder]]''. Zamora was played by [[Holly Marie Combs]].
* Two books were written about the case.&lt;ref name="ARN found guilty" /&gt;

==Notes==
{{notelist|refs=
{{efn|Zamora was the daughter of a nurse who worked up to three jobs simultaneously to support her family. Her father did not work regularly as an electrician, and he was an adulterer, which created feelings of betrayal and trust issues for Zamora. Due to financial difficulties, the family lived with Zamora's grandmother and grandfather, who was a minister. The Mexican-American family was religious and strict, including about who she dated. As the oldest child, she had responsibilities for taking care of her siblings. Zamora decided upon a career in the military when she was in middle school. She studied to make good grades and became a member of the [[National Honor Society]]. She had plans to join the Naval Academy and wanted to become a mission's specialist for [[NASA]].  At times, she hated her life and cut herself to relieve stress.&lt;ref name="CL Beneath" /&gt;|name="Zamora beneath"}}

|{{efn|Graham was the youngest of three children. He was business-like and polite in his manner with others, addressing others as sir and ma'am in his responses to them. He had a military-style haircut. He became interested in flying during an air show in [[Brownsville, Texas]] when he was in the first grade, and joined the Civil Air Patrol when he was 12. Graham was a good student, in the top 5% of all of the Class of 2000 cadets, and in high school he was a member of the high school's [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (Junior ROTC) program and track team. Even though some people saw him as the "perfect guy", he could be controlling and had a violent temper. His mother moved out of the family house due to her fear of him.&lt;ref name="CL Beneath" /&gt;|name="Graham beneath"}}

'''Donald Henry''' "'''Pee Wee'''" '''Gaskins Jr.''' (né '''Parrott'''; March 13, 1933 – September 6, 1991) was an American [[serial killer]].

Gaskins was born on March 13, 1933 in [[Florence County, South Carolina]] to Eulea Parrott,&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=0fgLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=Junior+was+the+child+of+Eulea+Parrot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tbNeJSSLdX&amp;sig=wXIUj1ZuOScHj_kcYen5OaTEq5s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMI_ab0jP_cyAIV1yyICh3U1gpd#v=onepage&amp;q=Junior%20was%20the%20child%20of%20Eulea%20Parrot&amp;f=false|title=PEE WEE Serial Killer or Homicidal Maniac|last=Query|first=O.

Gaskins' early life was characterized by a great deal of [[child neglect|neglect]]. When he was just one year old, Gaskins drank a bottle of [[kerosene]], which caused him to have convulsions until he was three years old. His mother apparently took so little interest in him that the first time he learned his given name—Donald—was when it was read out in his first court appearance, for a crime spree Gaskins committed along with a group of fellow delinquents which included [[robbery|robberies]], [[assault]]s and a [[gang rape]].&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 130"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greig|first=Charlotte|title=Evil Serial Killers: In the Minds of Monsters|date=2005|publisher=Foulsham &amp; Co Ltd.|location=New York City|isbn=0-7607-7566-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/evilserialkiller00char/page/130 130]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/evilserialkiller00char/page/130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his conviction for his role in the crime spree, Gaskins was sent to [[reform school]]. There, he was regularly [[rape]]d by his fellow inmates. After escaping from the school, getting married and voluntarily returning to complete his sentence, he was released in 1951, at the age of 18. Gaskins briefly worked on a [[Plantation economy|tobacco plantation]] until his 1953 arrest, after he attacked a teenage girl with a hammer for an alleged insult. Gaskins was sentenced to six years' imprisonment at the [[Central Correctional Institution|South Carolina Penitentiary]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Donald|last=Gaskins|first2=Wilton|last2=Earle|title=Final Truth: The Autobiography of a Serial Killer|publisher=Adept|ISBN=1-85286-494-X|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being raped and "owned" in prison, he earned his fellow prisoners' respect by killing the most feared man in the prison, Hazel Brazell. As a result, Gaskins received an extra three years in prison, but from that point on he became the aggressor instead of the victim. He escaped from prison in 1955 by hiding in the back of a garbage truck and fled to [[Florida]], where he took employment with a [[traveling carnival]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Encyclopaedia of serial killers {{ISBN|0-7472-3731-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-arrested, remanded to custody, and paroled in August 1961.

==Early Life==
Gaskins was born on March 13, 1933 in [[Florence County, South Carolina]] to Eulea Parrott,&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; the last in a string of [[legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate children]]. He was small for his age and immediately gained the nickname "Pee Wee". As an adult, he was 5' 2" (157 cm) and weighed approximately 130 lbs (59 kg).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Gaskins' early life was characterized by a great deal of [[child neglect|neglect]]. When he was just one year old, Gaskins drank a bottle of [[kerosene]], which caused him to have convulsions until he was three years old. His mother apparently took so little interest in him that the first time he learned his given name—Donald—was when it was read out in his first court appearance, for a crime spree Gaskins committed along with a group of fellow delinquents which included [[robbery|robberies]], [[assault]]s and a [[gang rape]].&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 130"/&gt;

Following his conviction for his role in the crime spree, Gaskins was sent to [[reform school]]. There, he was regularly [[rape]]d by his fellow inmates. After escaping from the school, getting married and voluntarily returning to complete his sentence, he was released in 1951, at the age of 18. Gaskins briefly worked on a [[Plantation economy|tobacco plantation]] until his 1953 arrest, after he attacked a teenage girl with a hammer for an alleged insult. Gaskins was sentenced to six years' imprisonment at the [[Central Correctional Institution|South Carolina Penitentiary]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In Prison he earned his fellow prisoners' respect by killing the most feared man in the prison, Hazel Brazell. As a result, Gaskins received an extra three years in prison, but from that point on he became the aggressor instead of the victim. He escaped from prison in 1955 by hiding in the back of a garbage truck and fled to [[Florida]], where he took employment with a [[traveling carnival]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He was re-arrested, remanded to custody, and paroled in August 1961.

==Final arrest==
Gaskins was arrested on November 14, 1975, when a criminal associate named Walter Neeley confessed to police that he had witnessed Gaskins killing Dennis Bellamy, aged 28, and Johnny Knight, aged 15.&lt;ref&gt;Final Truth. {{ISBN|1-85286-494-X}}, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Neeley confessed to police that Gaskins had confided in him to having killed several people who had been listed as [[missing person]]s during the previous five years, and had indicated to him where they were buried. On December 4, 1975, Gaskins led police to land he owned in [[Prospect, South Carolina|Prospect]], where police discovered the bodies of eight of his victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Margaret | last=O'Shea | title=Letter denies most killings | date=1991-09-07 | url=http://thedonaldhpeeweegaskinspage.com/Newspaper3.html | work=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]] | accessdate=2008-09-27 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007065940/http://thedonaldhpeeweegaskinspage.com/Newspaper3.html | archivedate=2008-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
Gaskins was tried on eight charges of murder on May 24, 1976,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Encyclopaedia of serial killers {{ISBN|0-7472-3731-X}}, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; found guilty on May 28 and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]], which was later [[Pardon|commuted]] to [[Life imprisonment|life in prison]] when the [[South Carolina General Assembly]]'s 1974 ruling on capital punishment was changed to conform to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] guidelines for the death penalty in other states.&lt;ref name=Shuler&gt;Shuler, Rita. 2006. Carolina Crimes: Case Files of a Forensic Photographer. The History Press: Charleston, SC.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 1982, Gaskins committed another murder, for which he earned the title of the "Meanest Man in America". While incarcerated in the high security block at the [[South Carolina Penitentiary|South Carolina Correctional Institution]], Gaskins killed a [[death row]] inmate named Rudolph Tyner, who had received his sentence for killing an elderly couple during a bungled armed [[robbery]] of their store in [[Burgess, South Carolina|Burgess]]. Gaskins was [[Contract killing|hired]] to commit this murder by Tony Cimo, the son of Tyner's victims.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Final Truth. {{ISBN|1-85286-494-X}}, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaskins initially made several unsuccessful attempts to kill Tyner by lacing his food and drink with poison before he opted to use explosives to kill him. To accomplish this, Gaskins rigged a device similar to a [[Radio receiver|portable radio]] in Tyner's cell and told Tyner this would allow them to "communicate between cells".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; When Tyner followed Gaskins' instructions to hold a speaker (laden with [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4 plastic explosive]], unbeknownst to him) to his ear at an agreed time, Gaskins detonated the explosives from his cell and killed Tyner.&lt;ref name=Shuler/&gt; He later said, "The last thing he [Tyner] heard was me laughing." Gaskins was tried for the Tyner's murder and sentenced to death. It was the first time in the history of South Carolina that a white man was sentenced to death for the murder of a black man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/22/us/columbia-journal-prison-lures-them-in-as-tourists.html|title=Columbia Journal; Prison Lures Them In (as Tourists)|date=1994-02-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Final Truth"==
While on death row, Gaskins told his life story to a journalist named Wilton Earle. He claimed to having committed between 100 and 110 murders,&lt;ref&gt;[http://crime.about.com/od/serial/p/gaskins3.htm Donald "Pee Wee" Gaskins - Part 3]&lt;/ref&gt; including that of Margaret "Peg" Cuttino, the 13-year-old daughter of then South Carolina State Senator James Cuttino Jr. of Sumter.

==Execution==

Gaskins was executed on September 6, 1991, at 1:10&amp;nbsp;a.m. He was the fourth person to die in the [[electric chair]] after the death penalty was reinstated in South Carolina in 1977.&lt;ref name=Shuler/&gt; Only hours before he was escorted to the electric chair at Broad River Correctional Institution, Gaskins tried to commit suicide by slitting his wrists with a razor blade he had swallowed the previous week, then coughed up. His [[last words]] were: "I'll let my lawyers talk for me. I'm ready to go."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prolifickillers.wordpress.com/2010/06/20/profile-of-an-american-serial-killer-pee-wee-gaskins-2/|title=Profile of an American Serial Killer: Pee Wee Gaskins|date=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Donato "Walter" Bilancia''', (born July 10, 1951) is an [[Italians|Italian]] [[serial killer]] who murdered seventeen people – nine women and eight men – on the [[Italian Riviera]] in the period from October 1997 to May 1998.&lt;ref name=BP/&gt;

Bilancia's inconsistent [[modus operandi]] made him difficult to identify and capture. There were no obvious links between the majority of his murders. He chose most of his victims at random, across a vast area of [[Northern Italy]] and becoming synonym for fear among the Italian Riviera population, being nicknamed ''Mostro della Liguria'' ("The Liguria Monster") and ''L'assassino dei treni'' ("Killer on the trains").

Initially attributed with only nine homicides by the [[Italian police]], Bilancia later confessed to having killed eight other people. With a sentence to 13 terms of [[life imprisonment]], and no possibility of release, Bilancia has been defined by some Italian newspapers as "the most horrifying serial killer in the history of Italy".&lt;ref name=DB1&gt;{{cite web|language=Italian|title=Donato Bilancia è uscito dal carcere.

==Biography==
===Background and early crimes===
[[File:Mercedes Benz 190 black vr.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Mercedes-Benz W201]]-190 used by Bilancia. It was an important point in the reconstruction of the facts that led to his identification.]]
Bilancia was born in [[Potenza]], [[Basilicata]], in 1951. When he was about five years old, his family moved to northern Italy, first to [[Piedmont]] and then to [[Genoa]] in the [[Liguria]] region.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt;  He was a chronic [[enuresis|bedwetter]] until age 10 or 12,&lt;ref name=occhirossi&gt;[http://www.occhirossi.it/biografie/DonatoBilancia.htm Donato Bilancia], Occhirossi {{in lang|it}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother shamed him by placing his wet mattress on the balcony where it could be seen by the neighbors.  When undressing him for bed, his aunt would shame him by pulling down his underwear in front of his cousins to show his underdeveloped penis.&lt;ref name=latelanera&gt;[http://www.latelanera.com/serialkiller/serialkillerdossier.asp?id=DonatoBilancia&amp;pg=1 Dossier Donato Bilancia], latelanera.com {{in lang|it}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At age 14, he decided to start calling himself Walter.  He dropped out of high school and worked at jobs such as mechanic, bartender, baker and delivery boy.&lt;ref name=occhirossi/&gt;

While still underage, he was arrested and released for stealing a [[motor scooter]] and for stealing a truck loaded with Christmas sweets.  In 1974 he was stopped and jailed for having an illegal gun.  At some point he was [[Involuntary commitment|committed]] to the [[psychiatric]] division of the Genoa General Hospital, but escaped.  After he was apprehended, he spent 18 months in prison for robbery.  He served several prison terms in Italy and France for robbery and armed robbery.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt; In spite of his history of psychiatric problems, up to age 47 he had no record of violence.&lt;ref name=BP2&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121104061632/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60778169.html Train-murders suspect may have killed eight], ''The Birmingham Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The murders===
[[File:Map of region of Liguria, Italy, with provinces-it.svg|180px|thumb|left|A map showing the subdivisions within the [[Liguria]] region. Most of Bilancia's murders took place in then existing [[Province of Genoa]] (Genova) – replaced by [[Metropolitan City of Genoa]], since 2015.]]
Bilancia was a [[compulsive gambler]] who lived alone.  His first murder was the October 1997 [[strangulation]] of a friend who betrayed him by luring him into a rigged card game, in which he lost £185,000 (about $267.00).&lt;ref name=BP&gt;[https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-60779096 Gambler's betrayal led to rampage of murder], ''The Birmingham Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities originally thought this death was a heart attack.&lt;ref name=TJ&gt;[http://murderpedia.org/male.B/images/bilancia_donato/CRI-0036.pdf From crime scene analysis to offender's personality: profile-generating process: the Bilancia case], Telematic Journal of Clinical Criminology&lt;/ref&gt;  Bilancia's next two murders were the revenge shooting of the game's operator, and of his wife.&lt;ref name=occhirossi/&gt; He emptied their safe afterward.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt; Bilancia later said these first killings gave him a taste for murder.&lt;ref name=BP/&gt;  In all his killings he used or carried a .38 caliber revolver loaded with [[wad cutter]] ammunition.  He made no attempt to conceal his victims' bodies.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt; That same month, he followed a jeweller home to rob him, then shot him and his wife dead when the wife began screaming.  He emptied their safe of jewelry.&lt;ref name=occhirossi/&gt; He next robbed and murdered a [[money changer]].  Two months later, he killed a [[security guard|night watchman]] making his rounds, simply because he did not like night watchmen. He killed an Albanian prostitute and a Russian prostitute. A second money changer was killed next, shot multiple times and his safe emptied.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt;
[[File:38 special wadcutter.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[.38 Special]] [[wadcutter]] bullets very similar to those used by Bilancia.]]
In March 1998, while receiving oral sex at gunpoint from a prostitute, he shot and killed two night watchmen who interrupted, then shot the prostitute, who survived to help develop a [[police sketch]] and later testify against him.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt; He also killed a Nigerian prostitute and a Ukrainian prostitute, and robbed and assaulted an Italian prostitute without killing her.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt; On April 12, 1998 he boarded the train from Genoa to Venice because he "wanted to kill a woman".  Spotting a young woman travelling alone, he followed her to the toilet, unlocked the door with a [[skeleton key]], shot her in the head and stole her train ticket.&lt;ref name=BP/&gt;
Six days later, he boarded the train to San Remo and followed another young woman to the toilet.  He used his key to enter, then used her jacket as a silencer and shot her behind the ear.  Excited by her black underwear, he masturbated and used her clothes to clean up.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt; The murders of two "respectable" women sparked a public outcry and the creation of a police [[task force]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/apr/14/rorycarroll No motive found as Italy's worst serial killer gets life], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last killing before his arrest, Bilancia murdered a service station attendant after filling up with petrol, then took the day's receipts, about 2 million [[lira]] (about $1000).

===Arrest and sentence===
Based on the description of the black Mercedes one of his prostitute victims was seen entering the night she was killed, police considered Bilancia "suspect number one" and followed him for ten days.  They collected his DNA from cigarette butts and a coffee cup, matching it to DNA found at crime scenes. On May 6, 1998 he was arrested at his home in Genoa and his revolver seized.&lt;ref name=Repubblica&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/online/fatti/liguria/liguria/liguria.html Serial killer, nel Dna la prova dei delitti], ''la Repubblica'' {{in lang|it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Record&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121104061645/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60566681.html  We've found the Ripper], ''Daily Record''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spiked&gt;[http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/2455/ What’s wrong with a National DNA Register?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622011326/http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/2455/ |date=June 22, 2011 }}, Spiked&lt;/ref&gt;  After eight days in police custody he confessed, speaking for two days and drawing 17 diagrams.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

On April 12, 2000, after an 11-month trial, Bilancia was sentenced to 13 terms of [[life imprisonment]] plus an additional 20 years imprisonment for the attempted murder of the prostitute who survived.&lt;ref name=CDS&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/cronache/08_febbraio_24/donato_bilancia_3402de7a-e2b4-11dc-a3c3-0003ba99c667.shtml Il doppio enigma del killer degli anonimi], ''Corriere della Sera'' {{in lang|it}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The judge ordered that he never be released.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

==Aftermath: in the media, personal goals and first temporal permission==
Bilancia's criminal life and the events that saw him as a cruel [[serial killer]] had a major impact in the [[media of Italy]]. His story inspired a [[television miniseries]], called ''Ultima pallottola'' ("The last bullet"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiction.mediaset.it/ultima-pallottola/stagione-1/|website=[[Mediaset]]|title=Ultima pallottola|accessdate=11 October 2018|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Michele Soavi]], broadcast for the first time in 2003 on [[Canale 5]], with actors [[Giulio Scarpati]], who plays as the officer during the investigations, and [[Carlo Cecchi]], as the serial killer.

In 2004 Donato Bilancia was interviewed live on [[Rai 1]] during the broadcast on ''[[Domenica in]]'', in that year conducted and hosted by [[Paolo Bonolis]]. The host received bitter criticism for the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2004/04_Aprile/25/bilancia.shtml|title=Domenica in, va in onda l'intervista al killer|language=Italian|date=25 April 2004|accessdate=11 October 2018|website=[[Corriere della Sera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cita web|url=https://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Spettacoli/2004/04_Aprile/26/bilancia.shtml|title=Bonolis, una domenica con il serial killer|language=Italian|website=[[Corriere della Sera]]|accessdate=11 October 2018|date=26 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Rai 3]] dedicated an episode to Bilancia, in the [[television show]] ''Stelle Nere'' ("Black Stars").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title = Donato Bilancia: il killer dei treni|url = https://www.raiplay.it/video/2015/02/Donato-Bilancia-il-killer-dei-treni---Stelle-nere-del-31012015-e495a1fb-45ab-4c52-b672-9c5bd683c54a.html|access-date=|series = Stelle Nere|network = [[RAI]]|date = 2015|season = 2015|url-access=registration |quote = April 1998.

That "someone" is Donato Bilancia, thief, gambler but, above all, ruthless serial killer.|language = Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Doodler''', also known as the '''Black Doodler''', is an unidentified [[serial killer]] believed responsible for up to 16 murders and three [[assault]]s of men in the LGBT community of [[San Francisco, California]], between January 1974 and September 1975.&lt;ref name="ency1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gijG7fSwvjAC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=%22doodler%22+san+francisco&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tn2pUd7sDc_0igLui4GQCQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22doodler%22%20san%20francisco&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes|last=Newton|first=Michael|publisher=Facts on File|year=2009|isbn=9781438119144|location=New York|page=111|pages=|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nickname was given due to the perpetrator's habit of sketching his victims prior to their sexual encounters and slayings by stabbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/news/doodler-back-in-limelight-despite-no-updates-to-case/|title='Doodler' Back in Limelight Despite No Updates to Case|last=Mojadad|first=Ida|date=2018-06-21|work=SF Weekly|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrator met his victims at gay nightclubs, bars and restaurants.&lt;ref name=ency1/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://media.ktvu.com/media.ktvu.com/photo/2018/06/21/Sf%20Chronicle%20Nov%2013%201975_1529605861531.JPG_5687939_ver1.0_640_360.jpg|title=One-Killer Theory In 6 S.F.

It is believed that the Doodler killed between five and sixteen people.&lt;ref name="bay"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dowd |first1=Katie |title=10 Bay Area cold cases that remain unsolved |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/10-Bay-Area-cold-cases-that-remain-unsolved-12872249.php |accessdate=2 December 2019 |work=SFChronicle.com |date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/news/meet-the-californian-serial-killers-who-havent-been-caught-yet/|title=Meet the Californian Serial Killers Who Haven't Been Caught...Yet - April 26, 2018 - SF Weekly|last=Mojadad|first=Ida|date=2018-04-26|work=SF Weekly|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A consistent method used in several of the killings was stabbing the victims in the front and back of their bodies in similar locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Sado Murder Horror|last=|first=|date=January 19, 1976|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the victims were white males.&lt;ref name="new" /&gt; Police theorized that the victims had all died after meeting with the suspect near the locations where their bodies were recovered.&lt;ref name=untold/&gt;

The suspect was described as a man between 19 and 25 of African descent. He was about six feet tall, with a slender build.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Miller |first1=Ryan W. |title='The Doodler' killed 5 gay men in 1970s San Francisco.

===Gerald Cavanaugh===
Gerald Earl Cavanaugh, a Canadian-American immigrant, is believed to be the Doodler's first victim.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was 49 at the time of his slaying, which had occurred by stabbing. Cavanaugh's fully clothed body was located on January 24, 1974, lying face-up on Ocean Beach in San Francisco, California, in the early hours of the morning.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/20/us/doodler-cold-case-murders/index.html|title=After more than 40 years, police say they have a suspect in cold case|last=Watt|first=Nick|date=June 21, 2018|work=CNN|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had died hours before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/sijhpdnqz94hvh4/The%20Doodler%20Investigation%20Timeline%20Presentation%20by%20Bryan%20William%20Randal.m4v?dl=0|title=2 Stabbing Deaths--One Suspect Arrested|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was determined to have been conscious at the time he was killed and had attempted to resist his killer because he had self-defense wounds.&lt;ref name="untold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theawl.com/2014/12/the-untold-story-of-the-doodler-murders|title=The Untold Story of the Doodler Murders|last1=Green|first1=Elon|date=11 December 2014|website=The Awl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111233226/https://www.theawl.com/2014/12/the-untold-story-of-the-doodler-murders/|archive-date=January 11, 2018|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially remained unidentified, being temporarily known as "John Doe #7" by the medical examiner. He was a single man and few details are available about his personal life.&lt;ref name=yesterday /&gt;

===Joseph "Jae" Stevens===
Joseph Stevens, best known by the nickname "Jae," was discovered on June 25, 1974, by a woman walking along [[Spreckels Lake]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://media.ktvu.com/media.ktvu.com/photo/2018/06/21/ViewScan_0001_1529605858816_5687937_ver1.0_640_360.jpg|title=Entertainer stabbed to death in GG Park|last=|first=|date=June 25, 1974|work=The San Francisco Examiner|access-date=September 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921011830/https://media.ktvu.com/media.ktvu.com/photo/2018/06/21/ViewScan_0001_1529605858816_5687937_ver1.0_640_360.jpg|archive-date=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevens was 27 and had died shortly before his body was found; he had been witnessed at a club the previous day. He was employed as a "female impersonator" and comedian. Officers suspected that Stevens was alive at the time he had been at Spreckels Lake, possibly transporting himself to the area with his killer.&lt;ref name=untold/&gt;

===Klaus Christmann===

Klaus Christmann, a German-American immigrant, was discovered by a woman walking her dog on July 7, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Police are asking for Help...|last=|first=|date=July 18, 1974|work=The San Francisco Sentinel|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|quote=Police are asking for help in the identification of this 25-year-old man that was found on Ocean Beach on July 7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death had been somewhat more violent than the previous murders because he had considerably more stab wounds than Stevens and had been slashed in the throat several times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The body was fully clothed.&lt;ref name=untold/&gt; Christmann, unlike the previous victims, was married and had children. The fact that he had a "make-up tube" on his person when he died suggested to police he may have been a closeted gay man.&lt;ref name=untold/&gt;

He remained unidentified briefly while police were investigating the cases, which they had believed were related after the third murder. He was buried in his native country.&lt;ref name=untold/&gt;

===Frederick Capin===
Frederick Elmer Capin, aged 32, was discovered on May 12, 1975, in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://media.ktvu.com/media.ktvu.com/photo/2018/06/21/ViewScan_0003_1529605859741_5687938_ver1.0_640_360.jpg|title=Body of stab victim found at Ocean Beach|last=|first=|date=May 12, 1975|work=The San Francisco Examiner|access-date=September 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921012421/https://media.ktvu.com/media.ktvu.com/photo/2018/06/21/ViewScan_0003_1529605859741_5687938_ver1.0_640_360.jpg|archive-date=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been stabbed like the other victims, dying from strikes to his [[aorta]]. It is believed his body had been moved approximately 20 feet as disturbances in the nearby sand indicated. Capin was identified through fingerprints when these were matched to those taken "by the state" due to his occupation as a nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Murder Unsolved|last=|first=|date=May 22, 1975|work=The San Francisco Sentinel|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had served in the United States Navy, earning medals while serving in the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name=untold/&gt;

===Harald Gullberg===

Harald Gullberg, aged 66, was a Swedish-American immigrant who was discovered on June 4, 1975 in a decomposed state about two weeks after his death in [[Lincoln Park (San Francisco)|Lincoln Park]].&lt;ref name="yesterday"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2015/10/08/yesterdays-crimes-the-serial-killer-who-stalked-gay-men-in-the-castro|title=Yesterday's Crimes: The Serial Killer Who Stalked Gay Men in the Castro|last1=Calhoun|first1=Bob|date=8 October 2015|work=SF Weekly|accessdate=25 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111233331/https://archives.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2015/10/08/yesterdays-crimes-the-serial-killer-who-stalked-gay-men-in-the-castro|archive-date=January 11, 2018|publisher=Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remains slightly inconsistent with the other homicides because he was far older than the others, his underwear had been taken by his killer and his pants were unzipped. Gullberg is believed to be the final victim of the Doodler.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While he remained unidentified, he was known as "John Doe #81."&lt;ref name=untold/&gt;

==Investigation==
[[File:Doodler Public Records Request.png|thumb|Letter from the SFPD's Legal Division detailing that the case is still active, and therefore they are unable to release any information.]]
Police questioned a young man as a murder suspect in the case, but could not proceed with criminal charges because the three surviving victims did not want to "[[outing|out]]" themselves by testifying against him in court.&lt;ref name="bay" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ency1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpM-DgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=TIME-LIFE The Most Notorious Serial Killers|last=of TIME-LIFE|first=Editors|publisher=Time Inc., Books|year=2017|isbn=1683300289|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the stabbing survivors were a "well-known entertainer" and a [[diplomat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://media.ktvu.com/media.ktvu.com/photo/2018/06/21/Sf%20Chronicle%20July%209%201977_1529605857279.JPG_5687936_ver1.0_640_360.jpg|title=The Mystery Witness in S.F.

Two other potential suspects arose in 1977 after a pair of men from Redondo Beach were arrested in Riverside County, California, and questioned on suspicion of approximately 28 murders that, like the San Francisco killings, occurred after "homosexual encounters."&lt;ref name=associatedpress1/&gt;

===Status===
As of May 2018, the case is open and ongoing in the San Francisco Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abc13.com/doodler-killer-cold-case-has-renewed-interest/3648515/|title='Doodler killer' cold case has renewed interest|date=2018-06-25|work=ABC13 Houston|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent successes using DNA technology developed in the decades since the crimes have led police to re-examine evidence in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/the-doodler-serial-killer-cold-case-unsolved-13014008.php#photo-6716706|title=Who was San Francisco's Doodler killer, and why wasn't he caught?|last=Dowd|first=Katie|date=June 21, 2018|work=SFGate|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/DNA-research-in-Golden-State-Killer-case-spurs-12889592.php|title=DNA research in Golden State Killer case spurs hope in unsolved killings|last=Fagan|first=Kevin|date=May 5, 2018|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=2018-06-13|last2=Sernoffsky|first2=Evan|quote=We’re still putting together all the various pieces in the Doodler case to see where it’s at.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2019, police offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the killer and released a revised sketch showing what he could look like four decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crime-doodler-idUSKCN1PW2XG|title=San Francisco police post reward for serial killer dubbed the...|date=2019-02-07|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-02-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later announced they would consider forensic genetic genealogy, which identified a suspect in the [[Golden State Killer]] murders.&lt;ref name="new" /&gt;

==Aftermath==

At the time, activist [[Harvey Milk]] publicly expressed empathy for the victims who refused to speak with police, stating "I understand their position. I respect the pressure society has put on them." Milk elaborated that the three men likely feared damaging relationships with family and in the workforce, citing that he believed "20% to 25%" of the 85,000 gay men in San Francisco were closeted about their sexualities.&lt;ref name=associatedpress1/&gt;

== Media ==

On February 19, 2019, it was announced on [[Deadline Hollywood]] that the San Francisco ‘Doodler’ killer would be the subject of a TV drama series written by [[Ryan J. Brown]] and produced by UK film company Ugly Duckling Films.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, Andreas (19 February 2019.

== Biography ==

Dorángel Vargas was born in 1956 to poor farmers. His priors included three arrests, two of them for minor offenses (theft of chickens and cattle). The third was acquired in 1995 when he was admitted to the Institute of Psychiatric Rehabilitation Peribeca for the murder of Baltazar Cruz Moreno, and the subsequent cannibalism of his body. He managed to escape from that center, and lead a seemingly normal life in poverty.

It is believed that he was actively murdering men between November 1998 and January 1999. Vargas hunted victims with a tube-shaped spear and occasionally with rocks. He kept the parts that he could cook and usually buried the feet, hands and heads. It seemed that his primary targets were unsuspecting athletes and laborers working on the riverbank. He did not eat women or children, and when asked why, he explained that he felt that they were too "pure" to consume.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|author = Nicki Peter Petrikowski|title = Cannibal Serial Killers|year = 2016|publisher = Enslow Pub Inc|isbn = 9780766072824|page = 104}} &lt;/ref&gt; Since he had no place to store the human flesh, most of it would decompose quickly, which made him kill routinely.&lt;ref name = "R2"/&gt;

On February 12, 1999, members of the [[civil defense]] found the remains of two young people and alerted the security forces. Searching around the same area, the remains of six more bodies were found. Hypotheses about the findings included the plot being a cemetery for corpses linked to drug gangs and even a burial ground for victims of Satanic cult rituals. The victims, after further investigation, were all found to have been missing persons. As the investigation progressed, Vargas became a suspect. An inspection of the shack that he was living in near the area revealed several vessels containing human flesh and viscera prepared for consumption, along with three human heads and several feet and hands.

In 2016, Vargas was involved in a prison riot in which he killed two other inmates and served their remains to other inmates.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/10/14/man-claims-son-was-eaten-by-fellow-inmates-during-riot-in-venezuelan-prison.html|title = Man claims son was eaten by fellow inmates during riot in Venezuelan prison|last = Vasquez|first = Alex|publisher = [[Fox News]]|date = 14 October 2016|website = foxnews.com|accessdate = 13 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite news|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-cannibalism/venezuela-probes-reports-of-prison-cannibal-deaths-idUSKBN12H1SZ|title = Venezuela probes reports of prison cannibal deaths|last = Polanco|first = Anggy|publisher = [[Reuters]]|date = 17 October 2016|newspaper = Reuters|accessdate = 13 April 2019}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederick Bailey Deeming''' (30 July 1853 – 23 May 1892) was an English-born Australian [[gasfitter]] and murderer. He was convicted and executed for the murder of a woman in [[Melbourne, Australia]]. He is remembered today because he was suspected by some of being the notorious serial killer, [[Jack the Ripper]].

Deeming was born in [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]], [[Leicestershire]], England, son of Thomas Deeming, brazier, and his wife Ann, née Bailey.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080288b.htm |title=Deeming, Frederick Bailey (1853–1892) |accessdate=15 September 2008 |author=Jones, Barry O. |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 8 |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press|MUP]] |year=1981 |pages=268–269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a "difficult child" according to writers Maurice Gurvich and Christopher Wray.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich, Maurice; and Christopher Wray (2007). ''The Scarlet Thread: Australia's Jack the Ripper, A True Crime Story.'' p.15,115. Sydney: Fairfax Books. {{ISBN|978-1-921190-42-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At 16 years of age, he ran away to sea, and thereafter he began a long career of crime, largely thieving and obtaining money under false pretenses. He was also responsible for the murder of his first wife Marie and his four children at [[Rainhill]], England, on or about 26 July 1891, and a second wife, Emily Mather, at [[Windsor, Victoria|Windsor]], Melbourne, on 24 December 1891.

Less than three months elapsed between the discovery of Mather's body in Windsor, Melbourne, in March 1892, and Deeming's execution for her murder in May 1892; a remarkably short time by comparison to modern western legal standards.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.290.&lt;/ref&gt; This was not only due to efficient police work, but also a result of the considerable international media interest the murder attracted. For example, it was an English journalist working for the [[The Argus (Australia)|''Melbourne Argus'']] who first approached Mather's mother in Rainhill and delivered the news of her daughter's murder.{{refn|group=nb|The account first appeared in ''The Argus'' on 14 March 1892; “Mrs. Mather had not heard of any murder in Melbourne [or]…the fate of her daughter. When I told her of the tragedy, she fainted.” Gurvich and Wray also list numerous newspaper reports on the Windsor murder.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.94-95.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Another factor was Deeming's behaviour in public, for while he often used different names, he usually drew attention to himself with behaviour variously described as aggressive, ostentatious, ingratiating and overly attentive to women.

==Australia in the 1880s==
Police investigations after his arrest in 1892&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/deeming/documents/vprs937-p0-u511-Precis.htm Victoria Police notes on Deeming's criminal career] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815235415/http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/deeming/documents/vprs937-p0-u511-Precis.htm |date=15 August 2008 }}. – Public Record Office Victoria. – Government of Victoria.&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that Deeming had moved to Australia in 1882, chiefly working in Sydney, but also working for John Danks, a Melbourne importer of plumbing and gas fitting supplies. His Melbourne employers regarded him as an excellent worker and extended him 200 pounds credit, supposedly to open a business in [[Rockhampton, Queensland]]. The money was never repaid.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.99.&lt;/ref&gt; Deeming is known to have worked for a Sydney gasfitter, where he was charged with theft of brass fittings from his employer. Deeming indignantly denied the theft, but the items were found at his home and he was sentenced to six weeks imprisonment. Deeming pretended to faint when the sentence was pronounced.&lt;ref name="Christopher Wray 2007 p.101"&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.101.&lt;/ref&gt; After his release, he continued to work in Sydney as a gasfitter until, in December 1887, he was again committed for trial, now on a charge of fraudulent insolvency. He disappeared from [[New South Wales]] while on bail.

Deeming was accompanied by his wife while in Australia, "a typical Welsh lass,"&lt;ref name="Christopher Wray 2007 p.101"/&gt; Marie, née James. Deeming had married her in Lower Tranmere, England in February 1881 and they had lived briefly at [[Birkenhead]] before leaving for Melbourne.&lt;ref name="Christopher Wray 2007 p.115"&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.115.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Alfred, had married Marie's sister, Martha. By 1886 Deeming and Marie had two Australian-born daughters, Bertha and Marie. In 1888 his brothers Alfred and Walter learned that Deeming and his family were returning to England "with a considerable fortune".&lt;ref name="Christopher Wray 2007 p.115"/&gt;

==South Africa and return to England==
Later police and newspaper research discovered Deeming had been active in [[Cape Town]], South Africa in 1888–1889, but his exact movements at this time are unclear and it appears he returned to [[Birkenhead]], England, at least once. Marie had another child at this time.{{refn|group=nb|He possibly travelled to South Africa without his family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/deeming/documents/vprs937-p0-u511-Precis.htm Victoria Police notes on Deeming's criminal career] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815235415/http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/deeming/documents/vprs937-p0-u511-Precis.htm |date=15 August 2008 }}. – Public Record Office Victoria. – Government of Victoria.&lt;/ref&gt;}} He was known to have been involved in conducting a [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] diamond mine swindle in 1889.&lt;ref name="Christopher Wray 2007 p.115"/&gt; His return to England via the steamship ''Yumna'' was well remembered by the Captain and passengers because of his ostentatious display of jewelry and money, and his unwanted attention to some of the female passengers.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

He had arrived at [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] by November 1889, lodging in the nearby town of [[Beverley]]. Here he passed himself off as "a retired sheep farmer" named ''Harry Lawson'' from Mount House Farm, [[Rockhampton, Queensland]], living on 1,500 [[pound sterling|pounds]] a year.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). pp. 106–7.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wooed Helen Matheson, the 21-year-old daughter of his landlady and married her, bigamously, on 18 February 1890.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;  About a month later, after a honeymoon in the south of England, he suddenly disappeared, taking his expensive gifts to Matheson with him. Deeming's wife and extended family had heard of his bigamous marriage to Matheson according to Gurvich and Wray.&lt;ref name="Christopher Wray 2007 p.115"/&gt;

Deeming was later found to have then visited Marie and his (now) four children in [[Birkenhead]]. He apparently gave Marie several hundred pounds and announced he was leaving for South America. He would send for her and the children once he was settled.&lt;ref name=MG-CW-p108&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.108.&lt;/ref&gt; Before leaving he conducted another swindle at a jeweler's in Hull. He was arrested for this on arrival at [[Montevideo]] and extradited back to England on a charge of "obtaining goods by false pretenses" being sentenced to nine months prison.&lt;ref name=MG-CW-p108 /&gt;

==Rainhill==
On his release from prison in July 1891, Deeming headed to the [[Liverpool]] area, settling into a hotel in the village of [[Rainhill]], Merseyside under the name ''Albert Williams''. A mysterious woman (almost certainly his wife Marie) who appeared at the hotel was dismissed as his "sister", visiting before she left for [[Port Said]]. Deeming then took a lease on Dinham Villa, a house in Rainhill, supposedly on behalf of a military friend, a certain "Colonel Brookes". However, Deeming himself took up residence at Dinham Villa, while a woman and several children were seen at the house and were again dismissed as merely his "sister and her children" visiting, who had "since returned home".&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, Deeming complained that the drains at Dinham Villa were defective, and the kitchen floor needed to be replaced. He closely supervised the work on the floor.

While in Rainhill, Deeming began to court Emily Lydia Mather,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/deeming/documents/vprs937-p0-u511-emilywilliamsportrait.htm Studio portrait of Mather] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918151245/http://prov.vic.gov.au/deeming/documents/vprs937-p0-u511-emilywilliamsportrait.htm |date=18 September 2009 }}. – Public Record Office Victoria. – Government of Victoria.&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of a widowed local shopkeeper, Mrs. Dove Mather. Mather and Deeming (as ''Albert Williams'') married on 22 September 1891.

==Windsor murder==
In November 1891, Deeming (still using the name ''Williams'') took Mather to Australia in the German steamship ''Kaiser Wilhelm II''. They arrived in Melbourne on 15 December 1891. Deeming rented a house on Andrew Street in [[Windsor, Victoria|Windsor]],&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; a suburb of Melbourne. On 24 December or early on 25 December 1891, he murdered Mather and buried her under the hearthstone of one of the bedrooms, covering the body with cement. He had paid a month's rent in advance, giving the name ''Mr. Drewn'', but almost immediately left the property. The owner, nearby butcher John Stamford, had been happy to rent to the man, because of his air of respectability, and at first, had not even known the man's name.

On 3 March 1892 a prospective tenant of the Windsor house complained of "a disagreeable smell" in the second bedroom.&lt;ref name=Proactive-n40-p4&gt;''Proactive'', Number 40, Winter 2007: Journal of the Public Records Office. "The Crime of Century Revisited". page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The owner and estate agent later raised the hearthstone to investigate whereupon the smell became so overpowering "they found themselves barely able to breathe".&lt;ref name=Proactive-n40-p4 /&gt;  The police were called and Mather's body found.  A postmortem conducted on 4 March found that although her skull had been fractured by several blows, the most likely cause of death was that her throat had been cut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/deeming/documents/vprs30-p0-u886-emilywilliamsautopsy.htm Autopsy report of Emily Mather] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918133804/http://prov.vic.gov.au/deeming/documents/vprs30-p0-u886-emilywilliamsautopsy.htm |date=18 September 2009 }}. – Public Record Office Victoria. – Government of Victoria.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DeemingRipper.jpg|thumb|left| alt=19th-century illustration of Deeming| 19th-century illustration comparing Deeming and 'Jack the Viper' of Whitechapel]]
Publicity surrounding the gruesome finding of Mather's body was considerable. Within a few days, ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper had connected the murder to the [[Whitechapel murders]] of London:

{{quote|From the outset a suspicion of insanity is almost suggested and a tinge of the Whitechapel murders is hinted. The body hacked and mangled, the cool manner in which the cementing was carried out, the taking a house etc, the laborious obliteration of all traces of the crime – all these things suggest the malevolence and craft which can scarcely accompany the sane murderer, no matter how callous and brutal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Age]] |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/18426723|title=Search For the Murderer: Discovery of Clues|page=7|date=5 March 1892|accessdate=11 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From clues found at the vacant Andrew Street house and from information provided by local tradespeople, including Stamford and his agent, a local laundress, an ironmonger who sold Deeming cement and several carriers, investigating [[Victoria Police]] sergeants William Considine and Henry Cawsey were able to trace the recently arrived ''Mr. Williams'' to the ''Kaiser Wilhelm II''. They were then able to interview other passengers, who gave corroborating descriptions of ''Mr. Williams'' and Mather. In the weeks at sea, Mather had talked to other passengers of her family at Rainhill, and the connection was now made. Deeming's behaviour as ''Mr. Williams'' had also attracted considerable attention during the voyage. Many passengers stated they "detested Williams, [but] all agreed he had treated his wife in a loving and considerate manner".&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.51.&lt;/ref&gt;  Police now also had a very good description of ''Mr. Williams'', which they circulated to other Australian colonies, but at this stage, his real identity was still unknown.

At an inquest held on 8 March, it was discovered that a man answering ''Mr. Williams''{{'}}s description had auctioned a variety of household goods, possibly wedding presents, in the city in early January 1892. At this time he was staying at the Cathedral Hotel in Swanston Street, Melbourne, registered as ''Mr. Duncan''. It later transpired that Deeming had also written an affectionate letter (as ''Albert Williams'') to Mather's mother several days after Mather's murder. Deeming had found time to approach Holt's Matrimonial Agency (as ''Duncan''), wishing to meet a young lady with matrimonial intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.65.&lt;/ref&gt; He had also found time to swindle a local Melbourne jeweller.

==Capture==
In the meantime, on or about 12 January 1892, Deeming had travelled to Sydney, and was now using the name ''Baron Swanston''. During the voyage and in Sydney Deeming met and courted Kate Rounsefell. He told Rounsefell that if she agreed to become his wife, "she would never regret it, and would always congratulate herself on having entered into matrimony with him".&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.84.&lt;/ref&gt;  After a whirlwind romance, during which Deeming gave Rounsefell several items of what was later shown to be stolen Melbourne jewellery, Rounsefell consented to marry ''Baron Swanston''. Having also agreed to follow him to Western Australia, Rounsefell and Deeming parted company. By means of forged testimonials, Deeming had obtained a position at a mine at [[Southern Cross, Western Australia|Southern Cross]].

On 22 January 1892 ''Baron Swanston'' departed for Fremantle. Again, Deeming as ''Baron Swanston'' made a name for himself on the ship, boasting of his wealth and position in society. He made approaches to Miss Maude Beech, a young woman in the care of her uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Wakeley. In this case, Deeming's charm came to nothing. Mr. Wakeley told ''Swanston''; "I may tell you plainly, that I don't believe your stories and I am not in the habit of allowing men of your class to enter my family circle."&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.89.&lt;/ref&gt; Once settled at Southern Cross, Deeming maintained a barrage of pleas to Rounsefell, writing on 8 February; "Don't keep me waiting dear. If you love me half as much as I love you, you would not keep me waiting a day".&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.90.&lt;/ref&gt; {{refn|group=nb|For the full text of this letter. Gurvich and Wray also argue that the suggestion Deeming purchased cement at South Cross, in preparation for Rounsefell's arrival, is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.276.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Police were closing in, however, and following telegrams by [[Victoria Police]] to Western Australia, Deeming was arrested at Southern Cross on 12 March 1892. He began by denying he was Deeming but later said "I think I know the party who has been murdered. I don't believe anyone would have the heart to murder a girl like that".&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; Found in his possession at the time of the arrest were a number of Mather's belongings, including her prayer book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/deeming/documents/vprs937-p0-u511-deemingpossessions.htm Deeming’s possessions on arrest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816042930/http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/deeming/documents/vprs937-p0-u511-deemingpossessions.htm |date=16 August 2008 }}. – Public Record Office Victoria. – Government of Victoria.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time Deeming was being returned to Melbourne, news of the discovery of the Rainhill murders in England arrived in Australia.&lt;ref name=Proactive-n40-p4/&gt;

==Rainhill murders==
Following publicity surrounding the discovery of Mather's body at Windsor, investigations at Rainhill revealed the decomposing bodies of Marie Deeming and the four children; Bertha (aged 10), Mary (7), Sidney (5) and Leala (18 months) buried beneath the re-concreted floor of Dinham Villa. The throats of most had been cut (Bertha had been strangled). The murder and burials had apparently occurred while Deeming (as ''Albert Williams'') was courting Mather, on or about 26 July 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.117.  NOTE: However, it may have been as late as 11 August 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; At an inquest held at Rainhill on 18 March 1892, Deeming's brothers identified Marie and gave some accounts of his activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/deeming/documents/images/australasian26mar1892.htm See: ''The Australasian''. 26 March 1892.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815234045/http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/deeming/documents/images/australasian26mar1892.htm |date=15 August 2008 }}. – Public Record Office Victoria. – Government of Victoria.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rainhill murders had gone undetected for eight months. It appears Deeming's brothers and Marie's sister had been led to believe that Marie and the children were in [[Brighton]] on a holiday and then assumed they were overseas again. Deeming had made several visits to Birkenhead to reassure Martha that her sister and the children were well.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.119.&lt;/ref&gt; Detection of the murders was also obstructed by Deeming's lease (as Williams) on Dinham Villa, which stipulated that the house should not be sold or relet for six months, because of the imminent arrival of Colonel Brookes and/or ''Williams''' sister. The lease also allowed ''Williams'' to resurface the concrete floor.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and Execution==
Furious demonstrations against Deeming were made on the journey to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and again on the way to [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]. Deeming was tried at Melbourne Supreme Court on 25 April 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.199.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution case was conducted by [[Robert Walsh (Australian politician)|Robert Walsh]], Q.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Australasia|Walsh, Hon. Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Deakin]], his counsel, tried to mount a plea of insanity. The defence also questioned the impact of newspaper reporting of Deeming on the jury.

Perhaps wishing to aid the defence of insanity, Deeming also claimed to have caught [[syphilis]] in London and to have received visitations from his mother's spirit, which urged his actions.  Before the jury retired, Deeming made a "lengthy,... rambling, speech of self-justification."  He repeated a story he had told police that Emily had "run off with another man". "That is my one comfort...knowing that she is not dead".&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.258-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeming was found guilty as charged, however.  Deeming spent the last days writing his autobiography and poetry; "The Jury listened well to the yarn I had to tell, But they sent me straight to hell."&lt;ref&gt;Gurvich &amp; Wray (2007). p.273.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also spent time talking to the [[Church of England]] ministers, to whom he supposedly confessed.  The sentence of the court was confirmed by the Executive Council on 9 May 1892 and the judicial committee of the Privy Council refused leave to appeal on 19 May 1892. Deeming was hanged at 10:01&amp;nbsp;am on 23 May 1892, he weighed  {{convert|143|lb|kg}}, {{convert|14|lb|kg}} less than when he entered prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deeming at the Gallows; The Wife Murderer Hanged at Melbourne This Morning |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=23 May 1892 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The autobiography which Deeming wrote in jail was destroyed.&lt;ref name=ADB /&gt;

===Jack the Ripper Theory===

As Australians struggled to comprehend the savageness of the Windsor murder, significant press speculation grew, suggesting Deeming was [[Whitechapel murders|Jack the Ripper]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/deeming/documents/vprs937-p0-u511-ripperhandwriting.htm  Newspaper clipping comparing Deeming's and Jack the Ripper's handwriting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815235246/http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/deeming/documents/vprs937-p0-u511-ripperhandwriting.htm |date=15 August 2008 }}. – Public Record Office Victoria. – Government of Victoria.&lt;/ref&gt; The speculation was also found in overseas reports of the case. For example, on 17 March 1892 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported the story with the headlines:

{{quote|Perhaps Jack the Ripper. The Startling discovery made in Liverpool. A Man arrested in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Perhaps Jack the Ripper. The Startling discovery made in Liverpool. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=17 March 1892 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Deeming's movements at many stages of his career are obscure, but it appears he may have been in England in late 1888, the time of the [[Whitechapel murders]]. Kreitmayer's Melbourne waxworks of 1912 probably reflected widespread public opinion when it depicted in wax Deeming burying Mather, commenting that it was suspected he was "identical with Jack the Ripper".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/vicpamphlets/0/0/0/pdf/vp0008.pdf Kreitmayers Waxworks pamphlet, see page 11. items 152 and 153] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612140354/http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/vicpamphlets/0/0/0/pdf/vp0008.pdf |date=12 June 2011 }}. – Government of Victoria. (Adobe Acrobat *.PDF document).&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation that Deeming was Jack the Ripper continues today&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/missing-skull-may-hold-melbourne-clue-in-hunt-for-jack-the-ripper-20090415-a74u.html |title=Missing skull may hold Melbourne clue in hunt for Jack the Ripper |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=15 April 2009 | first=Paul | last=Millar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robin Napper a former Scotland Yard detective and currently forensic researcher, along with a team of researchers, came to the conclusion that most of the evidence leads to Deeming as Jack the Ripper.

This aired on a Discovery Channel documentary in 2011. According to Napper the display of Deeming's death mask as that of "Jack the Ripper" in the [[Black Museum|Scotland Yard Museum of Crime]] shows that the police had, in fact, always considered him a prime suspect. The reason that the police officially dismissed Deeming as a suspect of the Whitechapel murders, according to Napper, is that they had believed he was either in jail at the time according to some&lt;ref&gt;''The Crimes, Detection and Death of Jack the Ripper'' by [[Martin Fido]], London, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. {{ISBN|0-297-79136-2}}, page 182; ''The Complete Jack the Ripper: Fully Revised and Updated'' by [[Donald Rumbelow]], Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-017395-1}}, page 268&lt;/ref&gt; or that he was in South Africa according to others.&lt;ref&gt;''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'' by Stewart P. Evans and Keith Skinner, Stroud, Gloucestershire, Sutton Publishing, 2001, {{ISBN|0-7509-2549-3}} page 241&lt;/ref&gt; But Napper proved that he was not in jail at the time, and pointed to evidence that he had in fact been back from South Africa to England at the time of the murders. He also pointed to a motive (incurring syphilis from a prostitute), a criminal profile and killing pattern that fitted exactly.&lt;ref&gt;Prime Suspect: Jack the Ripper, Discovery Channel, 2011; Narration by Dennis Cometti&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeming's death mask is on display at the [[Old Melbourne Gaol]] in Melbourne, where he was executed, and at the Black Museum at New Scotland Yard.

'''Hendrikje Geerts Meilofs Doelen''' (born June 1, 1784 in [[De Wolden|Oosterwijk]] – December 10, 1847 in [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]]) was a Dutch [[serial killer]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoewel in de literatuur 1780 of 1781 als geboortejaar genoemd worden is Drenlias stellig ''IJhorst/De Wijk, doopboek (1775-1812; DTB 164), 6 juni 1784, pagina 43 Gedoopt: Hendrikjen, geboren te Oosterwijk op 01-06-1784, dochter van Geert Meilofs en Neisjen Harms. ''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poisonings ==
On May 7, 1819, the farmwife Hendrikje Doelen married the almost six years older Aaldert Mulder in the [[Drenthe]] town of [[De Wijk]]. Both were poor day laborers. In 1827, both were admitted to the district's [[poorhouse]]. Suddenly, in 1845 several people mysteriously died. First of all, on April 7, her husband Aaldert and an old woman named Jantje Wichers, who was living with the couple, died. A few days later, the three children of Arend Hut, who also lived in the poorhouse, became ill after eating oatmeal pulp that they had received from Hendrikje. Half a year later, on October 14, her neighbour Grietje van Buren died after eating pancakes made by Hendrikje. Her daughter, Evertje, also became seriously ill after eating those same pancakes and died ten months later on August 9, 1846.

== Arrest and trial ==
Hendrikje was suspected of murdering the persons mentioned. After an investigation it was established that Wichers probably died from a natural death, but both the husband and Grietje van Buren were diagnosed with the presence of [[arsenic]]. Because no legal proof could be provided for her husband's murder, she was finally sentenced to death on January 15, 1847 for the murder of Van Buren by the provincial court of [[Assen]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Ruller 1987:84&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrikje denied her guilt at the hearing. But the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|Supreme Court]] rejected her [[cassation]] request, she acknowledged her guilt in her pardon request. She killed her husband because of the marital quarreling and her neighbour and daughter because of spite. The Supreme Court advised negatively about the petition, but the then [[minister of justice]] Marinus Willem de Jonge of Campensnieuwland&amp;nbsp;gave a positive advice, also in view of her age. King [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]] granted her clemency by [[Royal order (Belgium)|royal order]] on November 14, 1847.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Genade voor recht''  zijn de integrale teksten opgenomen van de adviezen van de Hoge Raad en de minister van Justitie in deze zaak (Van Ruller 1987:83 t/m 90)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 1847, she was displayed for half an hour with the noose on the scaffold in Assen. The death penalty was changed to a prison sentence of 20 years. She died, however, after eight days, on December 10, 1847 in the women's prison of Gouda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drenlias.nl/sid56bf35aefd6dbaffb9ada982b374e762/index.php?option=com_familias&amp;task=zoeken&amp;bron=na1811&amp;lname1=DOELEN&amp;fname1=HENDRIKJE&amp;header=advanced&amp;plaats=&amp;van=1848&amp;tot=1848&amp;methode=exact&amp;submit.x=21&amp;submit.y=14&amp;submit=Zoeken Drenlias]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑː|m|ər}}; May 21, 1960 – November 28, 1994), also known as the '''Milwaukee Cannibal''' or the '''Milwaukee Monster''', was an American [[serial killer]] and [[sex offender]] who committed the murder and [[dismemberment]] of 17 men and boys from 1978 to 1991. Many of his later murders involved [[necrophilia]],{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=136}} [[human cannibalism|cannibalism]], and the permanent preservation of body parts—typically all or part of the [[skeleton]].{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=214}}

Although he was diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]],{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992}} [[schizotypal personality disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J. Harold|last=Ellens|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E4_jAxfgteoC&amp;pg=PA181|title=Explaining Evil, Volume 1|publisher=Praeger|location=Santa Barbara, CA|date=2011|isbn=978-0-313-38715-9|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[psychosis|psychotic disorder]], Dahmer was found to be legally [[sanity|sane]] at his [[trial]]. He was convicted of 15 of the 16 murders he had committed in [[Wisconsin]], and was sentenced to 15 terms of [[life imprisonment]] on February 15, 1992.{{sfn|Campbell}} He was later sentenced to a 16th term of life imprisonment for an additional homicide committed in [[Ohio]] in 1978.

On November 28, 1994, Dahmer was beaten to death by [[Christopher Scarver]], a fellow inmate at the [[Columbia Correctional Institution (Wisconsin)|Columbia Correctional Institution]].

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer was born at the Evangelical Deaconess Hospital in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], United States,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=26}} on May 21, 1960, the first of two sons born to Joyce Annette (née Flint) and Lionel Herbert Dahmer. Dahmer's mother worked as a [[teleprinter|teletype machine]] instructor,{{sfn|Campbell}} and his father was a student at [[Marquette University]], working towards a degree in chemistry. His father was of [[German Americans|German]] and [[Welsh Americans|Welsh]] ancestry,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=19}} and his mother was of [[Norwegian Americans|Norwegian]] and [[Irish Americans|Irish]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Charles |last= Klotsche| title= The Silent Victims: The Aftermath of Failed Children on Their Mothers' Lives |publisher=[[Pan American Press]] |location=Los Angeles|year= 1995|isbn= 0-9673890-2-X |pages= 19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that Dahmer was deprived of attention as an infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Willem |last=Martens |title=Sadism Linked to Loneliness: Psychodynamic dimensions of the Sadistic Serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer |journal=[[Psychoanalytic Review]] |publisher=[[Guilford Press]]|location=New York City|date=August 2011 |volume=98|issue=4|pages=493–514 |doi= 10.1521/prev.2011.98.4.493 |pmid=21864144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources, however, suggest that generally, Dahmer was doted upon as an infant and toddler by both parents, although his mother was known to be tense, greedy for both attention and pity, and argumentative with her husband and their neighbors.{{sfn|Campbell|p=11}}

As her son entered first grade, Joyce Dahmer began to spend an increasing amount of her time in bed recovering from weakness. Lionel's university studies kept him away from home much of the time; when he was home, his wife demanded constant attention. She reportedly worked herself into a state of anxiety over trivial matters simply to appease her husband. On one occasion, Joyce Dahmer attempted suicide from an overdose of the [[Meprobamate|Equanil]] pills to which she had become addicted.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=32}} Consequently, neither parent devoted much time to their son.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=32}}{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=69–70}}

Dahmer has been described as being an "energetic and happy child" until he became notably subdued after undergoing a [[Inguinal hernia surgery|double hernia]] surgery, which was performed shortly before his fourth birthday.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=30}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeffrey Dahmer|url=https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/jeffrey-dahmer|website=[[Biography.com]]|publisher=[[A&amp;E Networks]]|accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled his early years of family life as being of "extreme tension" which he noted between his parents, whom he observed to be constantly arguing with each other. At elementary school, he was regarded as both quiet and timid by his peers. On his first grade report card, one teacher described Dahmer as a reserved child whom she sensed felt neglected.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=61}} This teacher did note that this sense of neglect seemed to stem from his mother's illnesses.{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=61–62}} Nonetheless, although largely reserved and uncommunicative in grade school, Dahmer did have a small number of friends.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=35–36}}

From an early age, Dahmer manifested an interest in dead animals. Friends later recalled Dahmer initially collected large insects, such as dragonflies and butterflies, which he placed inside jars. Later, he collected [[roadkill|animal carcasses from the roadside]], occasionally accompanied by one or more of his few friends; he dismembered these animals either at home or in an expanse of woodland behind the family home. According to one friend, Dahmer dismembered these animals and stored the parts in jars in the family's wooden toolshed, always explaining that he was curious as to how each animal "fitted together".{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=63}}

In one instance, he [[decapitation|decapitated]] the carcass of a dog before nailing the animal's body to a tree. He later impaled the skull of this dog{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=47}} upon a stake beside a wooden cross in woodland behind his house.{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=127}}{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=80}} Dahmer's fascination with dead animals might have begun when, at the age of four, he noted his father removing animal bones from beneath the family home. According to Lionel Dahmer, his son was "oddly thrilled" by the sound the bones made, and instantly developed a fixation for playing with and collecting animal bones. He occasionally searched beneath and around the family home for additional bones. With live animals, he explored their bodies to discover where their bones were located.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=32}}

The Dahmer family relocated to [[Doylestown, Ohio]], in October 1966.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=34}} At the time, Joyce Dahmer was pregnant with her second child. When she gave birth to a baby boy on December 18, 1966, Jeffrey was allowed to choose the name of the baby. He chose the name David for his younger brother.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=61}} The same year, Lionel Dahmer achieved his degree and subsequently obtained employment as an [[analytical chemistry|analytical chemist]] in the city of [[Akron, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Donald A.|last=Davis|title=The Jeffrey Dahmer Story: An American Nightmare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hSXCEA7LpjsC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=lionel+dahmer+analytical+chemist#v=onepage&amp;q=lionel%20dahmer%20analytical%20chemist|date=November 15, 1991|publisher=[[St. Martin's Paperbacks]]|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-312-92840-7|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the family relocated to [[Bath Township, Summit County, Ohio|Bath, Ohio]]. Two years later, over a family meal of chicken, Dahmer asked his father what would happen if the bones of the chicken were to be placed in a bleach solution.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=39}} Lionel Dahmer was, by this stage, concerned as to his elder son's placid and [[lethargy|lethargic]] attitude and his solitary existence; therefore, he was delighted at the initiative displayed by his son towards what he believed to be scientific curiosity.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=39}} He willingly demonstrated to his son how to safely bleach and (later) preserve animal bones. Dahmer used this knowledge regarding the cleansing and preserving of bones on many of the animal remains which he continued to avidly collect.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=46}}

===Adolescence and high school===
From his freshman year at [[Revere High School (Ohio)|Revere High School]], Dahmer was seen by his peers as an [[outcast (person)|outcast]] with few friends.{{refn|group=n|It has been suggested, in a 2002 paper by Silva, Ferrari and Leong published in the ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'', that Dahmer may have suffered from [[Asperger syndrome]].{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=127}}}} Many of Dahmer's classmates later recollected being disturbed by the fact that he drank both beer and [[distilled beverage|hard alcohol]], which he smuggled into school inside the lining of his army fatigue jacket{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=74}} and concealed in his locker. This drinking occurred before, during, and after school, and was first noted when Dahmer was 14. On one occasion, a classmate observed Dahmer consuming a cup of [[gin]] and asked him why he was drinking liquor in class, to which Dahmer casually replied, "It's my medicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=James|last1=Barron |first2=Mary B.

He initially achieved only average grades, which staff attributed to his [[apathy]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=45}} He was also known to have been a keen tennis player and to have briefly played in the high school band.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=42}}

When he reached puberty, Dahmer discovered he was [[homosexuality|gay]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=43–44}} He did not divulge his sexual orientation to his parents. In his early teens, he did engage in a brief relationship with another youth, although the pair never had intercourse.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=43}} By his later admission, he began sexually fantasizing about dominating and controlling a completely submissive male partner. These fantasies gradually became intertwined with [[dissection]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=51–52}}

On one occasion, when he was approximately 16 years old, Dahmer conceived a [[rape fantasy]] of rendering [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] a particular male jogger he found attractive, and then making sexual use of his unconscious body. To render the man unconscious, Dahmer concealed himself in bushes on the route he had noted the jogger took, baseball bat in hand, and lay in wait for him to run by. The jogger did not pass by on that particular day, however. Although Dahmer never attempted to implement this plan again,{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=51–52}} he later stated this was his first attempt to attack another individual.

Despite being regarded as a loner and an oddball among his peers at Revere High School, Dahmer became something of a [[wikt:class clown|class clown]] among some students due to the pranks he regularly staged—some of which were done to amuse his classmates, others apparently to simply attract attention.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=76}} These pranks became known as "Doing a Dahmer" and included bleating, simulating [[epileptic seizure]]s or [[cerebral palsy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= John |last= Backderf |title= My Friend Dahmer |publisher= [[Abrams ComicArts]] |location= New York City |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1-4197-0217-4 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/myfrienddahmergr0000derf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and knocking over items at school and at local stores.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=77}} By 1977, Dahmer's grades had declined, owing to his alcohol abuse and his continuing apathy toward academic and social interactions.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=76–79}}

His parents hired a private tutor for their son, but the tutor only had limited success. The same year, Dahmer's parents attended counseling sessions to try to resolve personal differences and thus save their marriage. The counseling was ultimately unsuccessful, and they decided to divorce. Although initially on amicable grounds, both of Dahmer's parents began to quarrel frequently in the presence of their sons and, in early 1978, Lionel Dahmer moved out of the house.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=56}}

In May 1978, Dahmer graduated from high school. A few weeks before his graduation, one of his teachers observed Dahmer sitting close to the school parking lot, drinking several cans of beer.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=57}} When the teacher threatened to report the matter, Dahmer informed him he was experiencing "a lot of problems" at home and that the school's [[school counselor|guidance counselor]] was aware of them. Shortly after this incident, Joyce was awarded [[child custody|custody]] of her younger son and vacated the family residence, moving in with family members of hers; Dahmer, having just turned 18, was legally an adult and therefore not subject to court custodial considerations.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=83}}

==Late teens and early 20s: first murder==

===Murder of Steven Hicks===
Dahmer committed his first murder in the summer of 1978 at the age of 18, just three weeks after his graduation. At the time, he was living alone in the family home. Owing to his recent divorce from Dahmer's mother, Dahmer's father temporarily lived in a nearby motel and his mother had relocated to [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin]],{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=100}} with his younger brother David. On June 18,{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=93}} Dahmer picked up a hitchhiker named Steven Mark Hicks who was four days shy of his 19th birthday.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=40}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mary B.W.|last=Taylor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/12/us/sorrow-and-frustration-on-trails-of-the-missing.html |title=Sorrow and Frustration On Trails of the Missing|work=The New York Times |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=August 12, 1991|access-date=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer lured the youth to his house on the pretext of the two young men drinking alcohol together. Hicks, who had been hitchhiking to a rock concert in Lockwood Corners,{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=90–91}} agreed to accompany Dahmer to his house. According to Dahmer, after several hours drinking and listening to music, Hicks "wanted to leave and [I] didn't want him to."&lt;ref name="PurcellArrigo2006"&gt;{{cite book |first2=Bruce |last2= A. Arrigo |first= Catherine E. |last= Purcell |title= The Psychology of Lust Murder: Paraphilia, Sexual Killing, and Serial Homicide|chapter-url= https://books.google.com/?id=ScBmlAEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA77 |year= 2006 |publisher= Academic Press |location=New York City|isbn= 978-0-12-370510-5 |page= 77 |chapter= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Dahmer bludgeoned him with a 10&amp;nbsp;lb. [[dumbbell]]. Dahmer later stated he struck Hicks twice from behind{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=67}} with the dumbbell as Hicks sat upon a chair. When Hicks fell unconscious, Dahmer [[strangulation|strangled]] him to death with the bar of the dumbbell, then stripped the clothes from Hicks' body before [[masturbation|masturbating]] as he stood above the corpse.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=67}} The following day,{{sfn|Masters|1993}} Dahmer dissected Hicks' body in his [[basement]]; he later buried the remains in a shallow grave in his backyard{{sfn|Roy|2002|p=102}} before, several weeks later, unearthing the remains and [[paring knife|paring]] the flesh from the bones.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=99}} He dissolved the flesh in acid before flushing the solution down the toilet; he crushed the bones with a [[sledgehammer]] and scattered them in the woodland behind the family home.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|pp=43–44}}

===Army service===
Six weeks after the murder of Hicks, Dahmer's father and his fiancée returned to his home where they discovered Jeffrey living alone at the house. That August, Dahmer enrolled at [[Ohio State University]], hoping to major in business.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=46}} Dahmer's sole term at Ohio State University was completely unproductive, largely because of his persistent alcohol abuse throughout the majority of the term. He received failing grades in Introduction to Anthropology, Classical Civilizations, and Administrative Science. The only course Dahmer was successful at was Riflery, having received a B- grade. His overall GPA was 0.45/4.0.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=105}}{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=103–104}} On one occasion, Lionel Dahmer paid a surprise visit to his son, only to find his room strewn with empty liquor bottles. Despite his father having paid in advance for the second term, Dahmer dropped out of university after just three months.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=104}}

In January 1979,{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=105}} on his father's urging, Dahmer enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]],{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=107}} where he trained as a medical specialist at [[Fort Sam Houston]] in San Antonio, Texas. On July 13, 1979, he was stationed in [[Baumholder]], [[West Germany]], where he served as a combat medic in [[68th Armor Regiment|2nd Battalion, 68th Armored Regiment]], [[8th Infantry Division (United States)|8th Infantry Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=James |last1=Barron |first2=Mary B.W.|last2=Tabor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/04/us/17-killed-and-a-life-is-searched-for-clues.html|title=17 Killed, and a Life Is Searched for Clues|work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|date=August 4, 1991|accessdate=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to published reports, in Dahmer's first year of service, he was an "average or slightly above average" soldier.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=108}}{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=108–109}}

Two soldiers attest to having been raped by Dahmer while in the army. One stated in 2010 that Dahmer had repeatedly raped him over a 17-month period while they were both stationed at Baumholder, while another soldier believes Dahmer drugged and raped him inside an [[armored personnel carrier]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Usborne|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/soldiers-sexual-abuse-and-the-serial-killer-the-us-military-s-secret-sexual-assaults-8679271.html|title=Soldiers, Sexual Abuse – and the Serial Killer: The US Military's Secret Sexual Assaults |work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England|date=June 28, 2013|access-date=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Jennifer|last1=Freyd|first2=Pamela|last2=Birrell|title=Blind to Betrayal: Why We Fool Ourselves We Aren't Being Fooled|publisher=Turner Publishing|location=Nashville, Tennessee|date=2013|isbn=978-0-470-60440-3|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to Dahmer's alcohol abuse, his performance deteriorated and, in March 1981, he was deemed unsuitable for military service and was later discharged from the Army.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=110–111}} He received an [[honorable discharge]], as his superiors did not believe that any problems Dahmer had in the Army would be applicable to civilian life.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=78}}

On March 24, 1981, Dahmer was sent to [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]], South Carolina, for debriefing and provided with a plane ticket to travel anywhere in the country. Dahmer later told police he felt he could not return home to face his father, so he opted to travel to [[Miami Beach, Florida]], both because he was "tired of the cold"&lt;ref name="adamWalsh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisn.com/news/10903529/detail.html |title=Did Dahmer Have One More Victim? |work=The Milwaukee Channel |accessdate=February 5, 2007 |date=February 1, 2007 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222031507/http://www.wisn.com/news/10903529/detail.html |archivedate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in an attempt to live by his own means. In Florida, Dahmer found employment at a [[delicatessen]] and rented a room in a nearby motel. Dahmer spent most of his salary on alcohol, and was soon evicted from the motel for non-payment. He initially spent his evenings on the beach as he continued to work at the sandwich shop until phoning his father and asking to return to Ohio in September of the same year.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=80}}

===Return to Ohio and relocation to West Allis, Wisconsin===
After his return to Ohio, Dahmer initially resided with his father and stepmother and insisted on being delegated numerous chores to occupy his time while he looked for work. He continued to drink heavily, and two weeks after his return Dahmer was arrested for [[public intoxication|drunk and disorderly conduct]],{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=114}} for which he was fined $60 and given a [[suspended sentence|suspended 10-day jail sentence]].{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=125}} Dahmer's father tried unsuccessfully to wean his son off alcohol. In December 1981, Dahmer's father and stepmother sent him to live with his grandmother in [[West Allis, Wisconsin|West Allis]], Wisconsin. Dahmer's grandmother was the only family member to whom he displayed any affection.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=82}} They hoped that her influence, plus the change of scenery, might inspire Dahmer to refrain from alcohol, find a job, and live responsibly.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=115}}{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=117}}

Initially, Dahmer's living arrangements with his grandmother were harmonious: he accompanied her to church; willingly undertook chores; actively sought work; and abided by most of her house rules (although he did continue to drink and smoke).{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=83}} This new influence in his life initially brought results and, in early 1982, Dahmer found employment as a [[phlebotomy|phlebotomist]] at the Milwaukee Blood Plasma Center. He held this job for a total of 10 months before being laid off.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=82}} He remained unemployed for over two years, during which he lived upon whatever money his grandmother gave him.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=135}}

Shortly before losing his job, Dahmer was arrested for [[indecent exposure]]. On August 7, 1982, at [[Wisconsin State Fair Park]], Dahmer was observed to expose himself to a crowd of 25 women and children. For this incident, he was convicted and fined $50 plus [[court costs]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=86}}

In January 1985, Dahmer was hired as a mixer at the Milwaukee Ambrosia Chocolate Factory, where he worked from 11 p.m to 7 a.m. six nights per week, with Saturday evenings off. Shortly after Dahmer found this employment, an incident occurred in which he was propositioned by another man while sitting reading in the West Allis Public Library. The stranger threw Dahmer a note offering to perform [[fellatio]] upon him. Although Dahmer did not respond to this proposition,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=88}} the incident stirred in his mind the fantasies of control and dominance he had developed as a teenager, and he began to familiarize himself with Milwaukee's [[gay bar]]s, bookstores and [[gay bathhouse]]s. He is also known to have stolen a male [[mannequin]] from a store,{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=119–120}} which he briefly used for sexual stimulation, until his grandmother discovered the item stowed in a closet and demanded that he discard it.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=91}}

By late 1985, he had begun to regularly frequent the bathhouses, which he later described as being "relaxing places",{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=92}} but during his sexual encounters, he became frustrated at his partners' moving during the sexual act. Following his arrest, he stated: "I trained myself to view people as objects of pleasure instead of [as] people".{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=92}} For this reason, beginning in June 1986, he administered [[hypnotic|sleeping pills]] to his partners, giving them liquor laced with the sedatives, then raping their unconscious bodies. After approximately 12 such instances, the bathhouses' administration revoked Dahmer's membership, and he began to use hotel rooms to continue this practice.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=94}}

Shortly after his membership of the bathhouses was revoked,{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=136}} Dahmer read a report in a newspaper regarding the upcoming funeral of an 18-year-old male. He conceived the idea of stealing the freshly interred corpse and taking it home.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite book |last= Schwartz |first= Anne E. |title= The Man Who Could Not Kill Enough: The Secret Murders of Milwaukee's Jeffrey Dahmer |date= 1992 |publisher= Citadel |isbn= 978-1-55972-117-2 |url= https://archive.org/details/manwhocouldnotki00schw}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dahmer, he attempted to dig the coffin from the ground, but found the soil too hard, before abandoning the plan.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=97}}

In August 1986,{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=131}} Dahmer was arrested for masturbating in front of two 12-year-old boys as he stood close to the [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic River]].&lt;ref name="Bardsley-7"/&gt;{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=137}} Dahmer initially admitted the offense and was again charged with indecent exposure, but quickly changed his story and claimed he had merely been urinating, unaware that there were witnesses. The charge was changed to [[disorderly conduct]] and, on March 10, 1987, Dahmer was sentenced to one year of [[probation]], with additional instructions he was to undergo counseling.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=139}}

==Late 20s and early 30s: subsequent murders==

===Ambassador Hotel===
On November 20, 1987, Dahmer—at the time residing with his grandmother in West Allis, Wisconsin—encountered a 25-year-old man from [[Ontonagon, Michigan]] named Steven Tuomi at a bar and persuaded him to return to the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Dahmer had rented a room for the evening. According to Dahmer, he had no intention of murdering Tuomi, but rather intended to drug and rape him as he lay unconscious. The following morning, however, he awoke to find Tuomi lying beneath him on the bed, his chest "crushed in" and "black and blue" with bruises. Blood was also seeping from the corner of his mouth, and Dahmer's fists and one forearm were extensively bruised. Dahmer stated he had no memory of having killed Tuomi,&lt;ref name="Bardsley-7"/&gt;{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=137}}{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=141}} and later informed investigators that he "could not believe this had happened."

To dispose of Tuomi's body, he purchased a large suitcase in which he transported the body to his grandmother's residence. There, one week later,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=110}} he severed the head, arms, and legs from the torso,{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=137}} then filleted the bones from the body before cutting the flesh into pieces small enough to handle. He then placed the flesh inside plastic garbage bags.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=110}} He wrapped the bones inside a sheet and pounded them into [[splinter]]s with a sledgehammer. The entire dismemberment process took Dahmer approximately two hours to complete, and he disposed of all of Tuomi's remains—excluding the severed head{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=111}}—in the trash.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=142}}

For a total of two weeks following Tuomi's murder, Dahmer retained the victim's head wrapped in a blanket. After two weeks, Dahmer boiled the head in a mixture of Soilex (an [[alkalinity|alkali]]-based industrial detergent) and bleach in an effort to retain the skull, which he then used as stimulus for masturbation. Eventually, the skull was rendered too brittle by this bleaching process, so Dahmer pulverized and disposed of it.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=111}}

===Intermediate incidents===
Following the murder of Tuomi, Dahmer began to actively seek victims, most of whom he encountered in or close to gay bars, and whom he typically lured to his grandmother's home. There, he drugged them before or shortly after engaging in sexual activity with them. Once he had rendered the victim unconscious with sleeping pills, he killed them by strangulation.{{sfn|Roy|2002|p=103}}

Two months after the murder of Steven Tuomi, Dahmer encountered a 14-year-old Native American [[male prostitute]] named James Doxtator; Dahmer lured the youth to his home with an offer of $50 to pose for nude pictures. At Dahmer's West Allis residence, the pair engaged in sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Doxtator and strangled him on the floor of the cellar.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=119}} Dahmer left the body in the cellar for one week before dismembering it in much the same manner as he had with Tuomi. He placed all of Doxtator's remains (excluding the skull) in the trash. He boiled the skull, and initially retained it before pulverizing it.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=151}}

On March 24, 1988, Dahmer met a 22-year-old [[bisexuality|bisexual]] man named Richard Guerrero outside a gay bar called The Phoenix.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=151}} Dahmer lured Guerrero to his grandmother's residence, although the incentive on this occasion was $50 to simply spend the remainder of the night with him;{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=121}} he then drugged Guerrero with sleeping pills and strangled him with a leather strap, with Dahmer then performing [[oral sex]] upon the corpse.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=121}} Guerrero's body was dismembered within 24&amp;nbsp;hours of his murder, with the remains again disposed of in the trash and the skull again retained before being pulverized several months later.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=129}}

On April 23, Dahmer lured another young man to his house; however, after giving the victim a drugged coffee, both he and the victim heard Dahmer's grandmother call, "Is that you, Jeff?"{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=166}} Although Dahmer replied in a manner that led his grandmother to believe he was alone, his grandmother did observe that Dahmer was not alone. Because of this, Dahmer opted not to kill this particular victim, instead waiting until he had become unconscious before taking him to the County General Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=19920208&amp;id=4OgzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yjIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3993,4435325 |title=Teen describes escape from Dahmer |work=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]]|location=Lodi, California|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=February 8, 1992 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1988, Dahmer's grandmother asked him to move out of her house because of his habit of bringing young men to her house late at night and the foul smells emanating from both the basement and the garage. Dahmer found a one-bedroom apartment on North 25th Street and moved into his new residence on September 25.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=132}} The following day, Dahmer was arrested for drugging and [[child sexual abuse|sexually fondling]] a 13-year-old boy whom he had lured to his home on the pretext of posing nude for photographs.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=133–135}} In January 1989, Dahmer was convicted of second-degree [[sexual assault]] and of enticing a child for immoral purposes.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=171}} Sentencing for the assault was suspended until May 1989.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=63}} On March 20,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=134}} Dahmer commenced a 10-day Easter absence from work, during which he moved back into his grandmother's home.

Two months after his conviction and two months prior to his sentencing for the sexual assault, Dahmer murdered his fifth victim. He was a [[mixed-race]] 24-year-old aspiring model named Anthony Sears, whom Dahmer met at a gay bar on March 25, 1989. According to Dahmer, on this particular occasion, he was not looking to commit a crime; however, shortly before [[last call (bar term)|closing time]] that evening, Sears "just started talking to me". Dahmer lured Sears to his grandmother's home, where the pair engaged in oral sex before Dahmer drugged and strangled Sears.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=136}}

The following morning, Dahmer placed the corpse in his grandmother's bathtub, where he decapitated the body before attempting to [[flaying|flay]] the corpse.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=136}} He then stripped the flesh from the body and pulverized the bones, which were again disposed of in the trash. According to Dahmer, he found Sears "exceptionally attractive", and Sears was the first victim from whom he permanently retained any body parts: he preserved Sears' head and genitalia in [[acetone]]&lt;ref name="Bardsley-8"/&gt; and stored them in his work locker. When he moved to a new address the following year, he took the remains there.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=197}}

On May 23, 1989,{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=63}} Dahmer was sentenced to five years' probation and one year in the House of Correction, with [[work release]] permitted in order that he be able to keep his job; he was also required to register as a [[sex offender]].{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=138}}

Two months before his scheduled release from the work camp, Dahmer was paroled from this regime. (His five years' probation imposed in 1989 began at this point.){{sfn|Masters|1993|p=138}} On release, Dahmer temporarily moved back to his grandmother's home in West Allis{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=143–144}} before, in May 1990, moving into the Oxford Apartments, located on North 25th Street in Milwaukee. Although located in a high crime area, the apartment was close to his workplace, was furnished and, at $300 per month inclusive of all bills excluding electricity, was economical.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=139}}

===924 North 25th Street===

====1990 killings====
On May 14, 1990, Dahmer moved out of his grandmother's house and into 924 North 25th Street, Apartment 213, taking Anthony Sears' [[mummification|mummified]] head and genitals with him.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=139}}{{refn|group=n|Shortly after moving into 924 North 25th Street, Dahmer purchased granite spray-paint from an art store. Having removed all flesh from Sears' head, he used this substance to spray-paint the skull and Sears' genitals. Dahmer also retained Sears' scalp.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=139–140}}}} Within one week of his moving into his new apartment, Dahmer had killed his sixth victim, Raymond Smith. Smith was a 32-year-old male prostitute whom Dahmer lured to Apartment 213 with the promise of $50 for sex.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=141}} At Dahmer's apartment, he gave Smith a drink laced with seven sleeping pills and manually strangled him.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=142}}

The following day, Dahmer purchased a Polaroid camera with which he took several pictures of Smith's body in suggestive positions before dismembering him in the bathroom. He boiled the legs, arms, and pelvis in a steel kettle with Soilex, which allowed him to then rinse the bones in his sink.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=142}} He dissolved the remainder of Smith's skeleton—excluding the skull—in a container filled with acid. Dahmer later spray-painted Smith's skull, which he placed alongside the skull of Anthony Sears upon a black towel inside a metal filing-cabinet.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=174}}

Approximately one week after the murder of Raymond Smith, on or about May 27, Dahmer lured another young man to his apartment. On this occasion, however, Dahmer himself accidentally consumed the drink laden with sedatives intended for consumption by his guest. When he awoke the following day, he discovered his intended victim had stolen several items of his clothing, $300, and a watch.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=142–143}} Dahmer never reported this incident to the police, although on May 29, he divulged to his probation officer that he had been robbed.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=143}}

In June 1990, Dahmer lured a 27-year-old acquaintance named Edward Smith to his apartment. He drugged and strangled Smith. On this occasion, rather than immediately acidifying the skeleton or repeating previous processes of bleaching (which had rendered previous victims' skulls brittle), Dahmer placed Smith's skeleton in his freezer for several months in the hope it would not retain moisture. Freezing the skeleton did not remove moisture, and the skeleton of this victim would be acidified several months later. Dahmer accidentally destroyed the skull when he placed it in the oven to dry—a process that caused the skull to explode. Dahmer himself was to later inform police he had felt "rotten" about Smith's murder as he had been unable to retain any parts of his body.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=146}}

Less than three months after the murder of Smith, Dahmer encountered a 22-year-old Chicago native named Ernest Miller on the corner of North 27th Street. Miller agreed to accompany Dahmer to his apartment for $50 and further agreed to allow him to listen to his heart and stomach. When Dahmer attempted to perform oral sex upon Miller, he was informed: "That'll cost you extra,"{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=153}} whereupon Dahmer gave his intended victim a drink laced with two sleeping pills.

On this occasion, he had only two sleeping pills to give his victim. Therefore, he killed Miller by slashing his [[carotid artery]] with the same knife he used to dissect his victims' bodies. Miller bled to death within minutes.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=154}} Dahmer then posed the nude body for various suggestive Polaroid photographs before placing the body in his bathtub for dismemberment. Dahmer repeatedly kissed and talked to the severed head while he dismembered the remainder of the body.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=154}}

He wrapped Miller's heart, biceps, and portions of flesh from the legs in plastic bags and placed them in the fridge for later consumption.{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=154–155}} Dahmer boiled the remaining flesh and organs into a "jelly-like substance" using Soilex, which again enabled him to rinse the flesh off the skeleton, which he intended to retain. To preserve the skeleton, he placed the bones in a light bleach solution for 24&amp;nbsp;hours before allowing them to dry upon a cloth for one week; the severed head was initially placed in the refrigerator before also being stripped of flesh, then painted and coated with enamel.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=154–155}}

Three weeks after the murder of Ernest Miller, on September 24, Dahmer encountered a 22-year-old man named David Thomas at the [[Shops of Grand Avenue|Grand Avenue Mall]] and persuaded him to return to his apartment for a few drinks, with additional money on offer if he would pose for photographs. In his statement to police after his arrest, Dahmer stated that, after giving Thomas a drink laden with sedatives, he did not feel attracted to him, but was afraid to allow him to awake in case he would be angry over having been drugged. Therefore, he strangled him and dismembered the body—intentionally retaining no body parts whatsoever. He photographed the dismemberment process and retained these photographs, which later aided in Thomas's subsequent identification.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=217}}

Following the murder of David Thomas, Dahmer did not kill anyone for almost five months, although on a minimum of five occasions between October 1990 and February 1991, he unsuccessfully attempted to lure men to his apartment.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=153}} He is also known to have regularly complained of feelings of both [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and depression to his probation officer throughout 1990; with frequent references to his sexuality, his solitary lifestyle, and financial difficulties. On several occasions, he is also known to have referred to harboring suicidal thoughts.{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=209–211}}

====1991 killings====
In February 1991, Dahmer observed a 17-year-old named Curtis Straughter standing at a bus stop near [[Marquette University]]. According to Dahmer, he lured Straughter into his apartment with an offer of money for posing for nude photos,{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=220–221}} with the added incentive of sexual intercourse. Dahmer drugged and strangled Straughter with a leather strap, then dismembered him, with Dahmer retaining the youth's skull, hands, and genitals and photographing each stage of the dismemberment process.

Less than two months later, on April 7, Dahmer encountered a 19-year-old named Errol Lindsey&lt;ref name="Bardsley-10"/&gt;{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=211}} walking to get a key cut. Lindsey was heterosexual. Dahmer lured Lindsey to his apartment, where he drugged him, drilled a hole in his skull and poured [[hydrochloric acid]] into it. According to Dahmer, Lindsey awoke after this experiment (which Dahmer had conceived in the hope of inducing a permanent, unresistant, submissive state), saying: "I have a headache. What time is it?"{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=128}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Killers|issue=5|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this, Dahmer again drugged Lindsey, then strangled him. He decapitated Lindsey and retained his skull; he then flayed Lindsey's body, placing the skin in a solution of cold water and salt for several weeks in the hope of permanently retaining it. Reluctantly, Dahmer disposed of Lindsey's skin when he noted it had become too frayed and brittle.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=158}}

By 1991, fellow residents of the Oxford Apartments had repeatedly complained to the manager of the Oxford Apartments, Sopa Princewill, of the foul smells emanating from Apartment 213, in addition to the sounds of falling objects and the occasional sound of a chainsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Alex|last=Prud'Homme|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973550-1,00.html |title=The Little Flat of Horrors|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=August 5, 1991 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princewill did contact Dahmer in response to these complaints on several occasions, although Dahmer initially excused the odors emanating from his apartment as being caused by his freezer breaking, causing the contents to become "spoiled". On later occasions, he informed Princewill that the reason for the resurgence of the odor was that several of his tropical fish had recently died, and that he would take care of the matter.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=162}}

On the afternoon of May 26, 1991, Dahmer encountered a 14-year-old named Konerak Sinthasomphone on Wisconsin Avenue. By coincidence, Sinthasomphone was the younger brother of the boy whom Dahmer had molested in 1988. He approached the youth with an offer of money to accompany him to his apartment to pose for Polaroid pictures. According to Dahmer, Sinthasomphone was initially reluctant to the proposal, before changing his mind and accompanying Dahmer to his apartment, where the youth posed for two pictures in his underwear before Dahmer drugged him into unconsciousness and performed oral sex on him.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=176}}

On this occasion, Dahmer drilled a single hole into Sinthasomphone's skull, through which he injected hydrochloric acid into the [[frontal lobe]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=176}} Before Sinthasomphone fell unconscious, Dahmer led the boy into his bedroom, where the body of 31-year-old Tony Hughes, whom Dahmer had killed three days earlier, lay naked on the floor.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=235}} According to Dahmer, he "believed [that Sinthasomphone] saw this body," yet did not react to seeing the bloated corpse—likely because of the effects of the sleeping pills he had ingested and the hydrochloric acid Dahmer had injected through his skull. Sinthasomphone soon became unconscious, whereupon Dahmer drank several beers while lying alongside Sinthasomphone before leaving his apartment to drink at a bar, then purchase more alcohol.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=177}}

In the early morning hours of May 27, Dahmer returned toward his apartment to discover Sinthasomphone sitting outside naked on the corner of 25th and State, talking in [[Lao Language|Lao]], with three distressed young women standing near him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Crocker| last=Stephenson|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oLUyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wBIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3124,5920894 |title=2 women say police failed to aid 14-year-old |work=Milwaukee Sentinel |date=July 26, 1991 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer approached the trio and explained to the women that Sinthasomphone (whom he referred to by an [[pseudonym|alias]]) was his friend, and attempted to lead him to his apartment by the arm. The three women dissuaded Dahmer, explaining they had phoned 911.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=7}}

Upon the arrival of two officers named [[John Balcerzak]] and Joseph Gabrish, Dahmer's demeanor relaxed: he informed the officers that Sinthasomphone was his 19-year-old boyfriend, that he had drunk too much following a quarrel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/26/us/officer-defends-giving-boy-back-to-dahmer.html |title=Officer Defends Giving Boy Back to Dahmer |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=August 26, 1991|access-date=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he frequently behaved in this manner when [[alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]]. The three women were exasperated and when one of the trio attempted to indicate to one of the officers that Sinthasomphone was bleeding from his buttocks and that he had seemingly struggled against Dahmer's attempts to walk him to his apartment, the officer harshly informed her to "butt out,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Barron |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/27/us/milwaukee-police-once-queried-suspect.html |title=Milwaukee Police Once Queried Suspect |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=July 27, 1991 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "shut the hell up"{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=179}} and to not interfere, adding the incident was "[[domestic violence|domestic]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Anne E.|last=Schwartz|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4DcdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NCwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6723,3131596|title=Suspended officers say the public doesn't know the whole story |work=The Milwaukee Journal |publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|date=July 28, 1991 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Against the protests of the three women, the officers simply covered Sinthasomphone with a towel and walked him to Dahmer's apartment where, in an effort to verify his claim that he and Sinthasomphone were lovers, Dahmer showed the officers the two semi-nude Polaroid pictures he had taken of the youth the previous evening. The officers later reported having noted a strange scent reminiscent of excrement inside the apartment (this odor emanated from the decomposing body of Hughes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Imrie |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xe0eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bCQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5153,134140 |title=Officers were in Dahmer's apartment |agency=Associated Press|work=The Times-News |publisher=[[New Media Investment Group]]|location=Burlington, North Carolina|date=August 2, 1991 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer stated that to investigate this, one officer simply "peeked his head around the bedroom but really didn't take a good look." The officers then left, with a departing remark that Dahmer "take good care" of Sinthasomphone.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=180}}

Had they conducted a background check on Dahmer, it would have revealed that he was a convicted [[child molestation|child molester]] under probation.&lt;ref name="Bardsley-3"/&gt; Upon the departure of the two police officers from his apartment, Dahmer again injected hydrochloric acid into Sinthasomphone's brain. On this second occasion, the injection proved fatal. The following day, May 28, Dahmer took a day's leave from work to devote himself to the dismemberment of the bodies of Sinthasomphone and Hughes. He retained both victims' skulls.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=182}}{{refn|group=n|Having left Sinthasomphone in the company of Dahmer, the patrol unit which had responded to the women's 911 call then radioed their dispatch unit. Above evident laughter from one or more of his colleagues, one officer informed his dispatch unit: "Intoxicated, Asian, naked male was returned to his sober boyfriend{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=235}} [...] My partner [is] going to get [[treatment of human head lice|deloused]] at the station.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=235}}{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=79}}}}

On June 30, Dahmer traveled to Chicago, where he encountered a 20-year-old named Matt Turner at a bus station.{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=252–253}} Turner accepted Dahmer's offer to travel to Milwaukee for a [[photo shoot|professional photo shoot]]. At Dahmer's apartment, Dahmer drugged, strangled and dismembered Turner and placed his head and internal organs in separate plastic bags in the freezer. Turner was not reported missing. Five days later, on July 5, Dahmer lured 23-year-old Jeremiah Weinberger from a Chicago bar to his apartment on the promise of spending the weekend with him. He drugged Weinberger and twice injected boiling water through his skull, sending him into a coma from which he died two days later.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=188–189}}

On July 15, Dahmer encountered 24-year-old{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=181}} Oliver Lacy at the corner of 27th and Kilbourn.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=254}} Lacy agreed to Dahmer's ruse of posing nude for photographs and accompanied him to his apartment, where the pair engaged in tentative sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Lacy. On this occasion, Dahmer intended to prolong the time he spent with Lacy while alive. After unsuccessfully attempting to render Lacy unconscious with [[chloroform]],{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=190}} he phoned his workplace to request a day's absence; this was granted, although the next day, he was suspended.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=181}}

After strangling Lacy, Dahmer had sex with the corpse before dismembering him. He placed Lacy's head and heart in the refrigerator and his skeleton in the freezer.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=181}} Four days later, on July 19, Dahmer received word that he was fired.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=194}} Upon receipt of this news, Dahmer lured 25-year-old Joseph Bradehoft to his apartment. Bradehoft was strangled and left lying on Dahmer's bed covered with a sheet for two days. On July 21, Dahmer removed these sheets to find the head covered in maggots, whereupon he decapitated the body, cleaned the head and placed it in the refrigerator.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=185}} He later acidified Bradehoft's torso along with those of two other victims killed within the previous month.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=90}}{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=258}}

==Arrest==
===Capture===
On July 22, 1991, Dahmer approached three men with an offer of $100 to accompany him to his apartment to pose for nude photographs,{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=15}} drink beer and simply keep him company.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=192}} One of the trio, 32-year-old Tracy Edwards, agreed to accompany him to his apartment. Upon entering Dahmer's apartment, Edwards noted a foul odor and several boxes of hydrochloric acid on the floor, which Dahmer claimed to use for cleaning bricks. After some minor conversation, Edwards responded to Dahmer's request to turn his head and view his tropical fish, whereupon Dahmer placed a handcuff upon his wrist. When Edwards asked, "What's happening?" Dahmer unsuccessfully attempted to cuff his wrists together,{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=151}} then told Edwards to accompany him to the bedroom to pose for nude pictures. While inside the bedroom, Edwards noted nude male posters on the wall and that a [[videotape]] of ''[[The Exorcist III]]'' was playing;{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=192}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL-SFva4Oko |title=The Trial of Jeffrey Dahmer – Documentary Part 12 of 16 |publisher=Youtube.com |date=February 4, 2012 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also noted a blue [[drum (container)|57-gallon drum]] in the corner, from which a strong odor emanated.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=152}}

Dahmer then brandished a knife and informed Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he would allow him to do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV. Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and [[chant]]ing before turning his attention back to him. He placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his [[cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=23}}

In continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and that he was not going to run away.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=24}} Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity. When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning. Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=27}} When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.{{sfn|Davis|1991|pp=153–154}}

At 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on July 22, Edwards flagged down two Milwaukee police officers at the corner of North 25th Street. The officers noted Edwards had a handcuff attached to his wrist,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=2}}{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=154}} whereupon Edwards explained to the officers that a "freak" had placed the handcuffs upon him and asked if the police could remove them. When the officers' handcuff keys failed to fit the brand of handcuffs, Edwards agreed to accompany the officers to the apartment where, Edwards stated, he had spent the previous five hours before escaping.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=2}}

When the officers and Edwards arrived at Apartment 213, Dahmer invited the trio inside and acknowledged he had indeed placed the handcuffs upon Edwards, although he offered no explanation as to why he had done so. At this point, Edwards divulged to the officers that Dahmer had also brandished a large knife upon him and that this had happened in the bedroom. Dahmer made no comment to this revelation, indicating to one of the officers, Rolf Mueller, that the key to the handcuffs was in his bedside dresser in the bedroom. As Mueller entered the bedroom, Dahmer attempted to pass Mueller to himself retrieve the key, whereupon the second officer present, Robert Rauth, informed him to "back off".{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=3}}

In the bedroom, Mueller noted there was indeed a large knife beneath the bed. He also saw an open drawer which, upon closer inspection, contained scores of Polaroid pictures—many of which were of human bodies in various stages of dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the very apartment in which they were standing. He walked into the living room to show them to his partner,&lt;ref name="Bardsley-4"/&gt; uttering the words, "These are for real."{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=3}}

When Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to resist arrest. The officers quickly overpowered him, cuffed his hands behind his back, and called a second squad car for backup. At this point, Mueller opened the refrigerator to reveal the freshly severed head of a black male on the bottom shelf.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=33}} As Dahmer lay pinned on the floor beneath Rauth, he turned his head towards the officers and muttered the words: "For what I did I should be dead."{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=4}}

A more detailed search of the apartment, conducted by the Criminal Investigation Bureau, revealed a total of four severed heads in Dahmer's kitchen. A total of seven skulls—some painted, some bleached—were found in Dahmer's bedroom and inside a closet.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=157}} In addition, investigators discovered collected blood drippings upon a tray at the bottom of Dahmer's refrigerator, plus two human hearts{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=158}} and a portion of arm muscle, each wrapped inside plastic bags upon the shelves. In Dahmer's freezer, investigators discovered an entire torso, plus a bag of human organs and flesh stuck to the ice at the bottom.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=6}}

Elsewhere in Apartment 213, investigators discovered two entire skeletons, a pair of severed hands, two severed and preserved penises, a mummified scalp and, in the 57-gallon drum, three further dismembered torsos dissolving in the acid solution. A total of 74 Polaroid pictures detailing the dismemberment of Dahmer's victims were found.&lt;ref name="Bardsley-5"/&gt; In reference to the recovery of body parts and artifacts at 924 North 25th Street, the [[coroner|chief medical examiner]] later stated: "It was more like dismantling someone's museum than an actual crime scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.medicineatmichigan.org/magazine/2009/spring/limelight/ |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821014601/http://www.medicineatmichigan.org/magazine/2009/spring/limelight/ |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |journal=Medicine at Michigan |title=Limelight |date=Spring 2009 |volume=11 |issue=1 |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confession===
Beginning in the early hours of July 23, 1991, Dahmer was questioned by Detective Patrick Kennedy as to the murders he had committed and the evidence found at his apartment. Over the following two weeks, Kennedy and, later, Detective Patrick Murphy conducted numerous interviews with Dahmer which, when combined, totalled over 60 hours.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=10}} Dahmer [[waiver|waived]] his right to have a lawyer present throughout his interrogations,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=21}} adding he wished to confess all as he had "created this horror and it only makes sense I do everything to put an end to it."{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=11}} He readily admitted to having murdered 16 young men in Wisconsin since 1987, with one further victim—Steven Hicks—killed in Ohio back in 1978.

Most of the victims had been rendered unconscious prior to their murder, although some had died as a result of having acid or boiling water injected into their brain. As he had no memory of the murder of Tuomi, he was unsure whether he was unconscious when beaten to death, although he did concede it was possible that his viewing the exposed chest of Steven Tuomi while in a drunken stupor may have led him to unsuccessfully attempt to tear Tuomi's heart from his chest.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=109–110}} Almost all the murders Dahmer committed after moving into the Oxford Apartments had involved a ritual of posing the victims' bodies in suggestive positions—typically with the chest thrust outwards—prior to dismemberment.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=159}}

He readily admitted to performing [[necrophilia]] with several of his victims' bodies, including performing sexual acts with their [[viscus|viscera]]{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=159}} as he dismembered their bodies in his bathtub. Having noted that much of the blood pooled inside his victims' chest after death, Dahmer first removed their internal organs, then suspended the torso so the blood drained into his bathtub, before [[dicing]] any organs he did not wish to retain and paring the flesh from the body.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=161}} The bones he wished to dispose of were pulverized or acidified, with Soilex and bleach solutions used to aid in the preservation of the skeletons and skulls he wished to keep. In addition, he confessed to having consumed the hearts, livers, biceps, and portions of thighs of several victims killed within the previous year.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=154}}

Describing the increase in his rate of killing in the two months prior to his arrest, he stated he had been "completely swept along"{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=198}} with his compulsion to kill, adding: "It was an incessant and never-ending desire to be with someone at whatever cost. Someone good looking, really nice looking. It just filled my thoughts all day long."{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=120–121}} When asked as to why he had preserved a total of seven skulls and the entire skeletons of two victims, Dahmer stated he had been in the process of constructing a private [[altar]] of victims' skulls which he had intended to display on the black table located in his living room and upon which he had photographed the bodies of many of his victims.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=286}}

This display of skulls was to be adorned at each side with the complete skeletons of Ernest Miller and Oliver Lacy. The four severed heads found in his kitchen were to be removed of all flesh and used in this altar, as was the skull of at least one future victim. [[Incense|Incense sticks]] were to be placed at each end of the black table, above which Dahmer intended to place a large blue lamp with extending blue globe lights.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=286}} The entire construction was to be placed before a window covered with a black, opaque shower curtain, in front of which Dahmer intended to sit in a black leather chair.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=286}} When asked in a November 18, 1991 interview who the altar was dedicated to, Dahmer replied: "Myself ... It was a place where I could feel at home." He further described his intended altar as a "place for [[meditation]]," from where he believed he could draw a sense of power,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=286}} adding: "If this [his arrest] had happened six months later, that's what they would have found."{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=286}}

===Indictment===
On July 25, 1991, Dahmer was charged with four counts of [[first-degree murder]]. By August 22, he had been charged with a further 11 murders committed in the state of Wisconsin.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=11}} On September 14, investigators in Ohio, having uncovered hundreds of bone fragments in woodland behind the address in which Dahmer had confessed to killing his first victim, formally identified two [[molar (tooth)|molars]] and a [[vertebral column|vertebra]] with X-ray records of Steven Mark Hicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19910914&amp;id=uPVHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qYAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4324,3674325|title=Bones identified at Dahmer home|work=[[The Victoria Advocate]]|publisher=Victoria Advocate Publishing|location=Victoria, Texas|date=September 14, 1991|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, Dahmer was charged by authorities in Ohio with the murder of Steven Hicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rogers |last=Worthington |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-08-07-9103260555-story.html |title=Dahmer Polite In Court As New Charges Are Filed |work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=August 7, 1991|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dahmer was not charged with the [[attempted murder]] of Tracy Edwards,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=11}} nor with the murder of Steven Tuomi. He was not charged with Tuomi's murder because the Milwaukee County [[district attorney|District Attorney]] only brought charges where murder could be proven beyond a [[reasonable doubt]]{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=56}} and Dahmer had no memory of actually committing this particular murder, for which no [[real evidence|physical evidence]] of the crime existed.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=56}} At a scheduled [[hearing (law)|preliminary hearing]] on January 13, 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hPohAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=S6MFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3446,5821944&amp; |title=Dahmer: Guilty, insane|work=[[Reading Eagle]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=January 13, 1992 |accessdate=December 5, 2013|via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer pleaded [[insanity defense|guilty but insane]] to 15 counts of murder.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=209–210}}

===Trial===
Jeffrey Dahmer's trial began on January 30, 1992.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=207}} He was tried in Milwaukee for the 15 counts of first-degree murder{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|pp=169–173}} before Judge Laurence Gram.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=227}} By pleading guilty on January 13 to the charges brought against him, Dahmer had waived his rights to an initial trial to establish guilt (as defined in Wisconsin law).{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=215}} The issue debated by opposing [[counsel]]s at Dahmer's trial was to determine whether he suffered from either a [[mental disorder|mental]] or a [[personality disorder]]:{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=215}} the prosecution claiming that any disorders did not deprive Dahmer of the ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to deprive him of the ability to resist his [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]]; the defense arguing that Dahmer suffered from a mental disease{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=269}} and was driven by obsessions and impulses he was unable to control.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=227–228}}

Defense experts argued that Dahmer was insane due to his necrophilic drive – his compulsion to have sexual encounters with corpses. Defense expert Dr. [[Fred Berlin]] testified that Dahmer was unable to conform his conduct at the time that he committed the crimes because he was suffering from [[paraphilia]] or, more specifically, [[necrophilia]]. Dr. Judith Becker, a professor of psychiatry and psychology, was the second expert witness for the defense; Becker also diagnosed Dahmer with necrophilia. The final defense expert to testify, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Carl Wahlstrom, diagnosed Dahmer with [[borderline personality disorder]], [[schizotypal personality disorder]], necrophilia, [[alcohol dependence]], and a [[psychosis|psychotic disorder]].{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992}}&lt;ref name="diagnosis"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Steve |last=Bogira |url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-inner-life-of-a-psycho-killer/Content?oid=880359 |title=The inner life of a psycho killer |magazine=[[Chicago Reader]]|date=August 27, 1992 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ewing|McCann|2006}}

The prosecution rejected the defense's argument that Dahmer was insane. Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Phillip Resnick testified that Dahmer did not suffer from primary necrophilia because he preferred live sexual partners as evidenced by his efforts to create unresistant, submissive sexual partners devoid of rational thought and to whose needs he did not have to cater.&lt;ref name="Silva"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J.

He described Dahmer as a calculating and cunning individual, able to differentiate between right and wrong, with the ability to control his actions.&lt;ref name="Deseret News"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.deseret.com/1992/2/10/18966874/psychiatrist-says-dahmer-was-sick-but-not-insane |title=Psychiatrist Says Dahmer Was Sick But Not Insane |work=[[Deseret News]]|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|date=February 10, 1992 |accessdate=September 10, 2010|via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fosdel did state his belief that Dahmer suffered from paraphilia, his conclusion was that Dahmer was not a [[sadistic personality disorder|sadist]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=255}}

The final witness to appear for the prosecution, forensic psychiatrist [[Park Dietz]], began his testimony on February 12. Dietz testified that he did not believe Dahmer to be suffering from any mental disease or defect at the time that he committed the crimes, stating: "Dahmer went to great lengths to be alone with his victim and to have no witnesses."{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=262}} He explained that there was ample evidence that Dahmer prepared in advance for each murder, therefore, his crimes were not impulsive.&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal Feb. 12, 1992"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Stingl|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dSohAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4n4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4713,3624402 |title=Dahmer knew what he was doing, expert says|work=The Milwaukee Journal|date=February 12, 1992 |accessdate=December 5, 2013|via=[[Google News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dietz did concede any acquisition of a paraphilia was not a matter of personal choice,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=262}} he also stated his belief that Dahmer's habit of becoming intoxicated prior to committing each of the murders was significant, stating: "If he had a compulsion to kill, he would not have to drink alcohol. He had to drink alcohol to overcome his inhibition, to do the crime which he would rather not do."&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal Feb. 12, 1992"/&gt;

Dietz also noted that Dahmer strongly identified with evil and corrupt characters from both ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' and ''The Exorcist III''; particularly the level of power held by these characters. Expounding on the significance of these movies on Dahmer's psyche and many of the murders committed at the Oxford Apartments, Dietz explained that Dahmer occasionally viewed scenes from these films before searching for a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |first=Park|last=Dietz|author-link= Park Dietz |year= 1992 |title= Jeffrey Dahmer, Return of the Jedi and Exorcist 3 |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsj7bXdaPho |accessdate= June 23, 2019 |quote= |ref= DahmerTrialVideo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dietz diagnosed Dahmer with [[substance use disorder]], paraphilia, and schizotypal personality disorder.{{sfn|Haycock|2014}}

Two court-appointed mental health professionals—testifying independently of either prosecution or defense—were forensic psychiatrist George Palermo and clinical psychologist Samuel Friedman. Palermo stated that the murders were the result of a "pent-up aggression within himself [Dahmer]. He killed those men because he wanted to kill the source of his homosexual attraction to them. In killing them, he killed what he hated in himself." Palermo concluded that Dahmer was a sexual sadist with [[antisocial personality disorder]], but legally sane.{{sfn|Ewing|McCann|2006|p=151}}

Friedman testified that it was a longing for companionship that caused Dahmer to kill. He stated, "Mr. Dahmer is not [[psychosis|psychotic]]." He spoke kindly of Dahmer, describing him as "Amiable, pleasant to be with, courteous, with a sense of humor, conventionally handsome, and charming in manner. He was, and still is, a bright young man."{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=214}}&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Solomon M.|last1=Fulero|first2=Lawrence Samuel|last2=Wrightsman |title= Forensic Psychology |year= 2008 |publisher= Cengage Learning |location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn= 978-0-495-50649-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He diagnosed Dahmer with a [[personality disorder not otherwise specified]] featuring [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder|obsessive-compulsive]], and [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19920206&amp;id=Z7UcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CGQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2548,3262701&amp;hl=en|title=The Pittsburgh Press - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial lasted two weeks.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=211}} On February 14, both counsels delivered their [[closing argument]]s to the jury. Each counsel was allowed to speak for two hours. Defense attorney Gerald Boyle argued first. Repeatedly harking to the testimony of the mental health professionals—almost all of whom had agreed Dahmer was suffering from a mental disease{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=268}}—Boyle argued that Dahmer's compulsive killings had been a result of "a sickness he discovered, not chose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19920215&amp;id=lHtOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oRQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1633,5266547|newspaper=Star News|date=February 15, 1992|title=Defense claims Dahmer was a 'killing machine'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle portrayed Dahmer as a desperately lonely and profoundly sick individual "so out of control he could not conform his conduct any more."{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=269}}

Following the defense counsel's 75-minute closing argument, Michael McCann delivered his closing argument for the prosecution, describing Dahmer as a sane man, in full control of his actions, who simply strove to avoid detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Doege|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19920215&amp;id=goZRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wRIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5809,4020474|title=Sane? Insane? Jury Ponders|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]|date=February 15, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCann argued that the act of murder was committed in hostility, anger, resentment, frustration, or hatred, and that the 15 victims for whose murder he was tried "died merely to afford Dahmer a period of sexual pleasure." McCann further argued that by pleading guilty but insane to the charges, Dahmer was seeking to escape responsibility for his crimes.

On February 15, the court reconvened to hear the verdict: Dahmer was ruled to be sane and not suffering from a mental disorder at the time of each of the 15 murders for which he was tried,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=272}} although in each count, two of the 12 jurors signified their [[dissent]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=272}} On the first two counts, Dahmer was sentenced to life imprisonment plus ten years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975527,00.html "Guilty! Call My Agent!"], ''Time'' magazine, May 18, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; with the remaining 13 counts carrying a [[mandate (criminal law)|mandatory]] sentence of life imprisonment plus 70 years. The death penalty was not an option for Judge Gram to consider at the penalty phase as the State of Wisconsin had abolished capital punishment in 1853.&lt;ref name="Bardsley-21"/&gt;

Upon hearing of Dahmer's sentencing, his father Lionel and stepmother Shari requested to be allowed a ten-minute private meeting with their son before he was transferred to the [[Columbia Correctional Institution (Wisconsin)|Columbia Correctional Institution]] in [[Portage, Wisconsin|Portage]] to begin his sentence.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=274}} This request was granted and the trio exchanged hugs and well-wishes before Dahmer was escorted away to begin his sentence.

Three months after his conviction for 15 murders in Milwaukee, Dahmer was [[extradition|extradited]] to Ohio to be tried for the murder of his first victim, Steven Hicks.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=241}} In a court hearing lasting just 45 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=M.

[[File:Columbia Correctional Institution Wisconsin with guard tower.jpg|190px|thumb|The [[Columbia Correctional Institution (Wisconsin)|Columbia Correctional Institution]]. Dahmer was imprisoned at this facility until his death in 1994]]
==Imprisonment==
Upon sentencing, Dahmer was transferred to the [[Columbia Correctional Institution (Wisconsin)|Columbia Correctional Institution]] in [[Portage, Wisconsin]].{{sfn|Campbell|p=36}} For the first year of his incarceration, Dahmer was placed in [[solitary confinement]] due to concerns for his physical safety should he come into contact with fellow inmates. With Dahmer's consent, after one year in solitary confinement, he was transferred to a less secure unit, where he was assigned a two-hour daily work detail cleaning the toilet block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://abc7chicago.com/news/jeffrey-dahmers-killer-explains-why-he-did-it/688971/|title=Jeffrey Dahmer's Killer Explains Why He Did It|access-date=July 21, 2017|newspaper=ABC7 Chicago|date=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly after completing his lengthy confessions in 1991, Dahmer had requested to Detective Patrick Murphy that he be given a copy of the [[Bible]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=215}} This request was granted and Dahmer gradually devoted himself to [[Christianity]] and became a [[born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]]. On his father's urging, he also read [[creationist]] books from the [[Institute for Creation Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnf1j4hRbjU|title=Full King Interview Dahmer parents Lionel and Shari|date=June 28, 2014|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1994, Dahmer was [[baptism|baptized]] by [[Roy Ratcliff]], a minister in the [[Churches of Christ|Church of Christ]] and a graduate of [[Oklahoma Christian University]], in the prison whirlpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JYZhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TbUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4821,6803994 |title=Dahmer found religion, played pranks in prison |work=[[The Beaver County Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=November 28, 1994 |accessdate=December 5, 2013|via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bardsley-22"/&gt;

Following his baptism, Ratcliff visited Dahmer on a weekly basis up until November 1994. Dahmer and Ratcliff regularly discussed the prospect of death, and Dahmer questioned whether he was [[sin]]ning against God by continuing to live.&lt;ref name="peoplemag1994"&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Elizabeth|last=Gleick|url=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-final-victim-vol-42-no-24/ |title=The Final Victim |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] |volume=42 |issue=24 |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=December 12, 1994|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to his crimes in a 1994 interview with [[Stone Phillips]] on ''[[Dateline NBC]]'', Dahmer had stated: "If a person doesn't think that there is a God to be accountable to, then what's the point of trying to modify your behavior to keep it within acceptable ranges? That's how I thought anyway."&lt;ref name="RatcliffAdams2015"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Roy|last1=Ratcliff|first2=Lindy|last2=Adams|title=Dark Journey Deep Grace: Jeffrey Dahmer's Story of Faith|publisher=Leafwood Publishers|location=Abilene, Texas|date=September 11, 2015|isbn=978-0-89112-891-5|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1994, a fellow inmate, Osvaldo Durruthy, attempted to slash Dahmer's throat with a razor embedded in a toothbrush as Dahmer returned to his cell from Roy Ratcliff's weekly church service conducted in the prison chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.deseret.com/1994/11/29/19145264/wisconsin-inmate-held-in-slaying-of-dahmer |title=Wisconsin Inmate Held in Slaying of Dahmer |newspaper=[[Deseret News]] |publisher=[[Deseret News Publishing Company]]|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=November 29, 1994 |accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer received superficial wounds and was not seriously hurt in this incident. According to Dahmer's family, he had long been ready to die, and accepted any punishment which he might endure in prison. In addition to his father and stepmother maintaining regular contact, Dahmer's mother, Joyce, also maintained regular contact with her son (although prior to his arrest, the two had not seen each other since Christmas 1983).{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=87}} Joyce Dahmer related that in her weekly phone calls, whenever she expressed concerns for her son's physical well-being, Dahmer responded with comments to the effect of: "It doesn't matter, Mom. I don't care if something happens to me."&lt;ref name="peoplemag1994"/&gt;

===Death===
On the morning of November 28, 1994, Dahmer left his cell to conduct his assigned work detail. Accompanying him were two fellow inmates: [[Jesse Anderson]] and [[Christopher Scarver]]. The trio was left unsupervised in the showers of the prison gym for approximately 20&amp;nbsp;minutes. At approximately 8:10&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Daley |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rOwbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CC0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1885,1125364 |title=Lock-down ordered for probe of Dahmer, Anderson deaths |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|The Milwaukee Journal]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|date=December 2, 1994 |pages=B1, B7 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer was discovered on the floor of the bathrooms of the gym suffering from extreme head and facial wounds;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dahmer Still wore Shackles at Autopsy |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19950317&amp;id=8oxQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TBMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6896,4930088 |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Sentinel]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|date=March 17, 1995|accessdate=November 7, 2018|via=[[Google News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had been severely bludgeoned about the head and face with a 20-inch (51&amp;nbsp;cm) metal bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Don |last=Terry |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/29/us/jeffrey-dahmer-multiple-killer-is-bludgeoned-to-death-in-prison.html |title=Jeffrey Dahmer, Multiple Killer, Is Bludgeoned to Death in Prison |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=November 29, 1994 |accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His head had also been repeatedly struck against the wall in the assault.{{sfn|Campbell|p=37}} Although Dahmer was still alive and was rushed to a nearby hospital, he was pronounced dead one hour later.

Scarver, who was serving a life sentence for a murder committed in 1990, informed authorities he had first attacked Dahmer with the metal bar as he (Dahmer) was cleaning a staff locker room, before attacking Anderson as he (Anderson) cleaned an inmate locker room. According to Scarver, Dahmer did not yell or make any noise as he was attacked. Immediately after attacking both men, Scarver, who was thought to be [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]], returned to his cell and informed a prison guard: "God told me to do it.

Upon learning of his death, Dahmer's mother Joyce Flint responded angrily to the media: "Now is everybody happy? Now that he's bludgeoned to death, is that good enough for everyone?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Janz |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MWSB&amp;p_theme=mwsb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB8289CA7DF7852&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id |title='It doesn't matter, Mom,' Dahmer said |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|date=November 29, 1994 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The response of the families of Dahmer's victims was mixed, although it appears most were pleased with his death. The district attorney who prosecuted Dahmer cautioned against turning Scarver into a [[folk hero]], noting that Dahmer's death was still murder.&lt;ref name="peoplemag1994"/&gt; On May 15, 1995, Scarver was sentenced to two additional terms of life imprisonment for the murders of Dahmer and Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v0IPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IIYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6589,559762 |title=Jeffrey Dahmer's Killer Gets 2 Life Sentences |work=[[Daily News (Kingsport)|Daily News]] |publisher=[[Sandusky Newspaper Group]]|location=Kingsport, Tennessee|agency=[[Reuters]] |date=May 17, 1995 |volume=24 |issue=70 |page=11 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Scarver had confessed in 1994 to having concealed the weapon used to kill Dahmer and Anderson in his clothing on the morning of the murders, in 2015, he publicly stated the murders of Dahmer and Anderson had resulted from a confrontation in which one of the two men had poked him (Scarver) in the back as the three had begun their assigned work detail. In this renewed account of events, Scarver claimed that the two had laughed at him when he had turned around in response before Dahmer and Anderson each walked to separate rooms to begin their cleaning duty, with Scarver following Dahmer toward the staff locker room.

Scarver alleges that immediately before murdering Dahmer, he had cornered him, presented a newspaper article detailing Dahmer's crimes, and demanded that Dahmer answer whether the account was true.&lt;ref name="NYP"/&gt; Scarver further alleged he had been revolted by Dahmer's crimes and that Dahmer had been openly unrepentant; that Dahmer taunted prison employees and fellow inmates by shaping his prison food into imitations of severed limbs, complete with ketchup to simulate blood spattering; and that prison staff, knowing of Scarver's hatred for Dahmer, had deliberately left the two men unsupervised so that he could kill him.&lt;ref name="NYP"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Jamie|last1=Schram|title=Why I killed Jeffrey Dahmer|url=https://nypost.com/2015/04/28/meet-the-prisoner-who-murdered-killer-cannibal-jeffrey-dahmer/|accessdate=April 29, 2015|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corp (2013–present)|News Corp.]]|location=New York City|date=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Scarver stated that Dahmer was so disliked by fellow inmates that he required a personal escort of at least one [[prison guard|guard]] whenever he was out of his cell to prevent inmates from attacking him.

Dahmer had stated in his [[will and testament|will]] he wished for no services to be conducted and that he wished to be [[cremation|cremated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/18/us/body-of-wisconsin-serial-killer-is-cremated.html |title=Body of Wisconsin Serial Killer Is Cremated |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=September 18, 1995 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1995, Dahmer's body was cremated, and his ashes divided between his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DBBIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3YAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4044,2046324 |title=Dahmer Cremated |newspaper=[[The Vindicator]] |location=Youngstown, Ohio |page=A3 |date=September 18, 1995 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Dahmer's [[estate (law)|estate]] was awarded to the families of 11 of his victims who had sued for damages. In 1996, Thomas Jacobson, a lawyer representing eight of the families, announced a planned auction of Dahmer's estate.

The group pledged $407,225, including a $100,000 gift by Milwaukee real estate developer Joseph Zilber, for purchase of Dahmer's estate; five of the eight families represented by Jacobson agreed to the terms, and Dahmer's possessions were subsequently destroyed and buried in an undisclosed Illinois [[landfill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=19960628&amp;id=ANQ_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=N-cFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3406,5717283|title=Dahmer belongings destroyed|newspaper=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|publisher=Ogden Newspapers, Inc.|location=Lawrence, Kansas|date=June 28, 1996|accessdate=November 24, 2018|via=[[Google News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lionel Dahmer is retired and now lives with his second wife, Shari. Both have refused to change their surname and have professed their love of Jeffrey in spite of his crimes. In 1994, Lionel published a book, ''A Father's Story,'' and donated a portion of the proceeds from his book to the victims' families.

==Known murder victims==
Jeffrey Dahmer is known to have killed 17 young men between 1978 and 1991. Of these victims, 12 were killed in his North 25th Street apartment. Three further victims were murdered and dismembered at his grandmother's West Allis residence, with his first and second victims being murdered at his parents' home in Bath, Ohio, and at the Ambassador Hotel in Wisconsin respectively. A total of 14 of Dahmer's victims were from various ethnic minority backgrounds, with nine victims being black. Dahmer was adamant that the race of his victims was incidental to him and that it was the body form of a potential victim that attracted his attention.{{sfn|Campbell|p=36}}{{refn|group=n|Despite Dahmer's insistence the race of his victims was incidental to him, some theorize the majority of his murders may have held a racial motive.&lt;ref&gt;''Erasing Racism: The Survival of the American Nation'' {{ISBN|978-1-615-92527-8}} p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth-Century Murder'' {{ISBN|978-1-858-91390-2}} p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, his victim selection may have simply been a result of his living in an ethnically mixed area, and the [[demography|demographics]] of the districts of Milwaukee and Chicago where he typically selected his victims.{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=127}}}}

Most of Dahmer's victims were killed by strangulation after being drugged with sedatives, although his first victim was killed by a combination of bludgeoning and strangulation and his second victim was battered to death, with one further victim killed in 1990, Ernest Miller, dying of a combination of [[acute stress reaction|shock]] and blood loss due to his carotid artery being cut.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=214}} Many of Dahmer's victims killed in 1991 had holes bored into their skulls through which Dahmer injected hydrochloric acid or, later, boiling water, directly into the brain{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=176–177}} in an attempt to induce a permanent, submissive, unresistant state. On at least three occasions, this proved fatal although on none of these occasions was this Dahmer's intention.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=188–189}}

===1978===
*'''June 18''': Steven Mark Hicks, 18. Last seen hitchhiking to a rock concert in [[Chippewa Lake Park]] in Bath, Ohio.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=89}} By Dahmer's admission, what caught his attention to Steven Hicks hitchhiking was the fact that the youth was bare-chested. He was bludgeoned with a dumbbell and strangled to death with this instrument before being dismembered. Remains pulverized and scattered in woodland behind Dahmer's childhood home.

===1987===
*'''November 20''': Steven Walter Tuomi, 25. Killed in a rented room at the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee. Dahmer claimed to have no memory of murdering Tuomi, yet stated he must have battered him to death in a drunken stupor. His body was dismembered in the basement of Dahmer's grandmother's house and the remains discarded in the trash. No remains were ever found.

===1988===
*'''January 16''': James Edward Doxtator, 14. Met Dahmer outside a gay bar in Wisconsin. Doxtator was lured to West Allis on the pretext of earning $50 for posing for nude pictures. Dahmer strangled Doxtator and kept his body in the basement for a week before dismembering him and discarding the remains in the trash. No remains were ever found.
*'''March 24''': Richard Guerrero, 22. Drugged and strangled in Dahmer's bedroom at West Allis. Dahmer dismembered Guerrero's corpse in the basement, dissolved the flesh in acid and disposed of the bones in the trash. He bleached and retained the skull for several months before disposing of it.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=120}} No remains were ever found.

===1989===
*'''March 25''': Anthony Lee Sears, 24. Sears was the last victim to be drugged and strangled at Dahmer's grandmother's residence; he was also the first victim from whom Dahmer permanently retained any body parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dahmer Charged in Eight Deaths |date=August 7, 1991 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=az0pAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yGUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5679,1156034/Sun |newspaper=Sun Journal|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His preserved skull and genitals were found in a filing cabinet at 924 North 25th Street following Dahmer's arrest in 1991.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=7}}

===1990===
*'''May 20''': Raymond Lamont Smith (also known as Ricky Beeks), 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/1991/11/jeffrey-dahmer-dennis-nilsen-serial-killer|title=Jeffrey Dahmer's Inferno|first=Condé|last=Nast|website=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first victim to be killed at Dahmer's North 25th Street apartment. Smith was a male sex worker whom Dahmer encountered at a tavern. Dahmer gave Smith a drink laced with sleeping pills, then strangled him on his kitchen floor.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=141}} His skull was spray-painted and retained.
*'''June 14''': Edward Warren Smith, 27.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=175}} A known acquaintance of Dahmer who was last seen in his company at a party.{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=199–200}} Dahmer acidified Smith's skeleton; his skull was destroyed unintentionally when placed in the oven in an effort to remove moisture.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=144}} No remains were ever found.
*'''September 2''': Ernest Marquez Miller, 22. Miller was a dance student whom Dahmer encountered outside a bookstore. According to Dahmer, he was especially attracted to Miller's [[physical attractiveness|physique]]. He was killed by having his carotid artery severed before being dismembered in the bathtub, with Dahmer storing his entire skeleton in the bottom drawer of a filing cabinet and his heart, biceps, and portions of his legs in the freezer for later consumption.
*'''September 24''': David Courtney Thomas, 22. Encountered Dahmer near the Grand Avenue Mall; he was lured to Dahmer's apartment on the promise of money for posing nude. Once a laced drink had rendered Thomas unconscious, Dahmer decided he "wasn't my type." Nonetheless, Dahmer strangled Thomas, taking Polaroid photos of the dismemberment process. No remains were ever found.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=217}}

===1991===
*'''February 18''': Curtis Durrell Straughter, 17. Approached by Dahmer as he waited at a bus stop near Marquette University. Dahmer lured Straughter to his apartment, where the youth was drugged, and then handcuffed and strangled before being dismembered in the bathtub. His skull, hands, and genitals were retained.
*'''April 7''': Errol Lindsey, 19. The first victim upon whom Dahmer practiced what he later described to investigators as his "drilling technique," a procedure in which he drilled holes into the victim's skull, through which he injected hydrochloric acid into the brain. According to Dahmer, Lindsey awoke after this practice, after which he was again rendered unconscious with a drink laced with sedatives, then strangled to death. Dahmer flayed Lindsey's body and retained the skin for several weeks.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=13}} His skull was found following Dahmer's arrest.
*'''May 24''': Tony Anthony Hughes, 31. Hughes was a [[deaf-mute]] whom Dahmer lured to his apartment upon the promise of posing nude for photographs. As Hughes was deaf, he and Dahmer communicated using handwritten notes. He was strangled and his body left on Dahmer's bedroom floor for three days before being dismembered, with Dahmer photographing the dismemberment process. His skull was retained and identified from dental records.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=178}}
*'''May 27''': Konerak Sinthasomphone, 14. The younger brother of the boy Dahmer had assaulted in 1988. Sinthasomphone was drugged and had hydrochloric acid injected into his brain before Dahmer left the youth unattended as he left the apartment to purchase beer. When he returned, he discovered Sinthasomphone naked and disoriented in the street, with three distressed young women attempting to assist him. When police arrived, Dahmer persuaded them he and Sinthasomphone were lovers and that the youth was simply intoxicated. When police left Sinthasomphone with Dahmer in his apartment, Dahmer again injected hydrochloric acid into Sinthasomphone's brain, and this proved fatal. His head was retained in the freezer and his body dismembered.
*'''June 30''': Matt Cleveland Turner, 20. On June 30, Dahmer attended the [[Chicago Pride Parade]]. At a bus stop, he encountered a 20-year-old named Matt Turner and persuaded him to accompany him to Milwaukee to pose for a photo shoot. Turner was drugged, strangled, and then dismembered in the bathtub. His head and internal organs were put in the freezer and his torso subsequently placed in the 57-gallon drum Dahmer purchased on July 12.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=183}}
*'''July 5''': Jeremiah B. Weinberger, 23. Met Dahmer at a gay bar in Chicago and agreed to accompany him to Milwaukee for the weekend. Dahmer drilled through Weinberger's skull and injected boiling water into the cavity. He later recalled Weinberger's death to be exceptional, as he was the only victim who died with his eyes open.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=49}} Weinberger's decapitated body was kept in the bathtub for a week before being dismembered; his torso was placed in the 57-gallon drum.
*'''July 15''': Oliver Joseph Lacy, 24. A bodybuilding enthusiast whom Dahmer enticed to his apartment on the promise of money for posing for photographs. Lacy was drugged and strangled with a leather strap before being decapitated, with his head and heart being placed in the refrigerator.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=14}} His skeleton was retained to adorn one side of the private shrine of skulls and skeletons Dahmer was in the process of creating when arrested one week later.
*'''July 19''': Joseph Arthur Bradehoft, 25. Dahmer's last victim. Bradehoft was a father of three children from [[Minnesota]] who was looking for work in Milwaukee at the time of his murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Victim in Serial Slaying Leaves Behind a Wife; Three Children |date=July 26, 1991 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19910726&amp;id=3jcdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NCwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4914,2602947 |publisher=Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was left on Dahmer's bed for two days following his murder before, on July 21, being decapitated.

'''Léopold Dion''' (February 25, 1920 - 17 November 1972) was a Canadian [[sex offender]] and [[serial killer]] who was active in [[Quebec]] in the 1960s. He was nicknamed the "Monster of [[Pont-Rouge]]".

==Crimes==
His first [[sexual assault]], which also involved an [[attempted murder]], was against a young woman from Pont-Rouge. Léopold Dion and his brother [[rape]]d and stabbed the woman on the railway track linking the Rang Petit-Capsa (a street) to the village of Pont-Rouge. They left her for dead, but she survived, albeit with both physical and psychological injuries.

Dion [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] 21 boys, killing four. He lured his victims by posing as a photographer.

His first [[murder]] victim was 12-year-old Guy Luckenuck, in Quebec City that day for clarinet lessons. This boy came from Kénogami. They travelled together every week to take music lessons at the Conservatoire de Musique du Québec in Québec City. Dion lured the boy by taking a series of snapshots with an old camera that had no film before claiming to want to continue elsewhere. He drove the boy into the country, where, in a remote spot, Dion then strangled him, and then buried him.&lt;ref name="www2.canoe.com"&gt;http://www2.canoe.com/cgi-bin/imprimer.cgi?id=127221 Réseau Canoë&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 May 1963, Dion crossed paths with eight-year-old Alain Carrier and 10-year-old Michel Morel. He used the same ploy to lure them into his car, driving them to a run-down building in [[Saint-Raymond-de-Portneuf]]. With Alain, he pretended to play prisoner so that he could tie the boy up in the cottage. Once the younger boy had been overcome, Dion turned to the older one, Michel, whom he led outside, whereupon he asked the child to take his clothes off. Dion then strangled him with a garrote, before going back inside and smothering the other boy.&lt;ref name="www2.canoe.com"/&gt;

On 26 May 1963, he met 13-year-old Pierre Marquis, who was also taken in by the fake photographer’s promises. They were a couple of paces from a dune, the same one that had become Guy Luckenuck’s grave a bit more than a month earlier. Once again, Dion asked his victim to pose naked. The child complied, but when Dion tried to assault him, he fought back before succumbing to the assault. Dion strangled Marquis.

==Arrest==
Dion, who was then on conditional release for raping a schoolteacher several years earlier, was arrested the day after his last murder. It was a description of Dion from another boy whom he had waylaid, but who had gotten away from him, that led to the police apprehending Dion. Once in prison, Dion held out for a month before he finally admitted to his crimes in detail to his interrogators. He then led investigators to the spot where he had buried the children's bodies.&lt;ref name="www2.canoe.com"/&gt;

==Trial==
Criminal lawyer [[Guy Bertrand (lawyer)|Guy Bertrand]] defended Dion at his trial. Dion was, in the end, charged with only one murder, Pierre Marquis', due to a lack of evidence in the other cases. On 10 April 1964, Judge Gérard Lacroix sentenced him to be [[Hanging|hanged]].

The [[death sentence]] was [[clemency|commuted]] to [[life imprisonment]] by then [[Governor General of Canada]] [[Georges Vanier]] after Bertrand's appeal to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the matter had failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b3avocats.com/fmset_contenue.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326071130/http://www.b3avocats.com/fmset_contenue.htm |archivedate=2009-03-26 }} Guy Bertrand's own account&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 17 November 1972, Dion was stabbed to death by a fellow inmate named Normand "Lawrence d'Arabie" Champagne, who was later found not guilty of this crime by [[insanity defense|reason of insanity]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erudit.org/revue/crimino/1976/v9/n1-2/017057ar.pdf "Littérature carcérale québécoise", issue of "Érudit"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marc Paul Alain Dutroux'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/hno19022004_071|title=Het mirakel van Marcinelle|date=31 January 2004|work=[[Het Nieuwsblad]]|access-date=14 June 2018|language=nl-BE|trans-title=The miracle of Marcinelle}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-fr|dytʀu|lang}}; born 6 November 1956) is a Belgian convicted child molester and murderer.

Dutroux was convicted in 1989 for the abduction and rape of five young girls (with his then-wife Michelle Martin) and other accomplices. He was released on parole after three years in prison.

In 1996, Dutroux was arrested on suspicion of having kidnapped, tortured and sexually abused six females aged between 8 and 19, four of whom died. His widely publicised trial took place in 2004. Dutroux was convicted of all charges, along with the murder of a suspected former accomplice, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Martin was convicted as an accomplice to 30 years in prison. Another accomplice Michel Lièvre was convicted to 25 years in prison. Michel Nihoul was first trialed with Marc Dutroux but then convicted in a separate case to five years in prison. Another accomplice of Marc Dutroux, Bernard Weinstein, was killed by him and thus never trialed.

A number of shortcomings in the Dutroux investigation caused widespread discontent in Belgium with the country's criminal justice system, and the ensuing scandal was one of the reasons for the reorganisation of [[Law enforcement in Belgium|Belgium's law enforcement]] agencies and widespread allegations of corruption and infiltration of the Belgian justice system by a criminal enterprise. In the [[White March]], 300,000 Belgian citizens protested the mishandling of the case.

==Early life and early criminal career==
Born in [[Ixelles]], Belgium, on 6 November 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2009|title=Marc Dutroux|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1012618/Marc-Dutroux|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutroux was the eldest child of five of Victor and Jeanine, who were both teachers. He spent the first years of his life in Congo. After the Congo crisis his parents had to return to Belgium.&lt;ref name="murderpedia"&gt;{{cite web|year=2009|title=Marc Dutroux|publisher=murderpedia|url=https://murderpedia.org/male.D/d/dutroux-marc.htm|date=}} {{unreliable?|date=November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutroux reported that he was repeatedly beaten by his parents. His parents divorced in 1971 and Dutroux left home. He then became a drifter and a male prostitute.&lt;ref name="murderpedia"/&gt; Dutroux married at age 20 and had two children. He admitted to beating his wife and cheating on her. They separated in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="murderpedia"/&gt; One of his mistresses was Michelle Martin, who he later married and had three more children with.&lt;ref name="murderpedia"/&gt; Dutroux and Martin were married in 1989 while both were in prison. They divorced in 2003, also while in prison.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

===Early release of Dutroux after abduction and rapes===
Dutroux had already committed similar crimes (kidnapping and rape of young girls). He had been imprisoned for that in 1989.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Trueheart |first1=Charles |title=SORDID TIMES IN DEAR BELGIUM' |url=http://archive.is/jxiLV#selection-3715.53-3715.70|website=washingtonpost.com |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=8 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was however released early and was thus able to reoffend. Namely he was released in 1991 after only serving three and a half years of a thirteen-year sentence.&lt;ref name="telegraphcover"/&gt;&lt;ref name="consortiumnews"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vos |first1=Elizabeth Lea |title=The Revelations of WikiLeaks: No. 4—The Haunting Case of a Belgian Child Killer and How WikiLeaks Helped Crack It |url=https://consortiumnews.com/2019/07/11/the-revelations-of-wikileaks-no-4-the-haunting-case-of-a-belgian-child-killer-and-how-wikileaks-helped-crack-it/ |website=consortiumnews.com |publisher=consortiumnews |accessdate=8 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutroux abducted Axelle D. on 14 December 1985. During her testimony, she told the police that Dutroux's accomplice Peteghem had told her that "he was part of a gang" led by two gang leaders, "an Italian and a crazy stupid one." Jean van Peteghem admitted to have taken part in the abduction. He said he had abducted Axelle D. with Marc Dutroux and Michelle Martin. He had lived with Dutroux after being discharged from the military and having his marriage fail. Peteghem told police that the first victims of his and Dutroux were two girls from Morlanwelz. These two victims were never recovered by police. On 7 June 1985 the first proven abduction by the two took place. They abducted eleven-year-old Sylvie D.. On 17 October 1985 the pair abducted Maria V., 19, from Peronnes-lez-Binche. Maria V. also identified a third man that took part in her abduction and appeared to be in his fifties. The man was never found by police. On 17 January 1986 Catherine B., 18, was abducted from Obaix. Dutroux had one or two accomplices in her abduction that were never found by police. Peteghem was stationed as army personnel in Germany during that time and could not have assisted Dutroux. On 18 December 1985, Dutroux abducted Elisabeth G., 15, in Pont-à-Celles. Peteghem told police that Dutroux filmed Elisabeth naked and took pictures of her. At the beginning of February 1987, Martin, Dutroux and Peteghem were arrested. This had to a large extent been the fault of Peteghem who had given out a lot of information about him in conversations with the girls, which had been enough for police to identify him. The three were eventually convicted on 26 April 1989. Dutroux received 13.5 years. Peteghem received 6.5 years and Martin received 5 years. Dutroux received a harsher sentence because he had also committed several robberies with Peteghem. Dutroux was thus additionally convicted for the brutal robbery of a 58-year-old woman. The robbery was also committed with accomplices. One of the accomplices in this robbery was also never found by police.&lt;ref name="nieuwsbald"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dutroux had zijn lesje geleerd |url=https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/hno19022004_049 |website=nieuwsblad.be |publisher=Bieuwsblad |accessdate=9 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early release of Dutroux was against the advice of the public prosecutor and against the advice of the psychiatrist who had examined him in prison and stated that he remained dangerous.&lt;ref name="nieuwsbald"/&gt;

The early release was granted by [[Melchior Wathelet]].&lt;ref name="zeit"&gt;{{cite web |title=Die Spuren führen zu den Einflußreichen |url=https://www.zeit.de/2004/10/dutroux2 |website=zeit.de |publisher=Die Zeit |accessdate=9 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melchior Wathelet was at that time the Belgian minister of justice.

===Granting Dutroux state assistance, sleeping pills and sedatives===
While in jail Dutroux managed to convince a health professional that he was disabled because of mental illness. He thus was able to collect public assistance by the Belgium government of $1,200 a month. He, furthermore, convinced the professional that he needed sedatives for sleeping problems. Dutroux later went on to use those sedatives to sedate his victims.&lt;ref&gt;ok|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7umgCOBEMgEC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;sig=0dGQs7ptXQcOK6NWGkN91cUT7rU&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwA2oVChMIwOKpq8GlxwIVyjkaCh0OnQYf#v=onepage&amp;q=Charleroi%20high%20unemployment%201990s|title=Globalization and Integrated Area Development in European Cities|last=Moulaert|first=Frank|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2000|isbn=|location=|page=86|pages=}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/5072276/Charleroi-the-most-depressing-city-in-Europe-becomes-more-depressing-by-the-day.html| date= 29 March 2009| title= Charleroi: the most depressing city in Europe becomes more depressing by the day |newspaper= The Telegraph| accessdate= 20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He owned seven small houses, most of them vacant, and used three of them for the torture of the girls he kidnapped. Even though he owned several houses his state assistance wasn't cut. In his residence in [[Marcinelle]], he constructed a concealed dungeon in the basement. Dutroux has been described by [[psychiatrist]]s who examined him for trial as a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1040618/asp/foreign/story_3385982.asp|title=Evil Belgian found guilty|last=|first=|date=17 June 2002|work=[[The Telegraph India]]|location=Calcutta|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes after release==
On 24 June 1995, eight-year-old classmates Julie Lejeune and Mélissa Russo were kidnapped after going for a walk in [[Grâce-Hollogne]], probably by Dutroux,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/01/world/europe/accomplice-in-belgian-child-killings-paroled-to-convent.html|title=Accomplice in Belgian child killings paroled to convent|last=|first=|date=31 July 2012|work=|access-date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and brought to his house in Marcinelle. Dutroux kept them imprisoned in the dungeon he had created, repeatedly sexually abused them and produced [[Child pornography|pornographic]] videos of the abuse. Two months later, in the early hours of 23 August in [[Ostend]], Dutroux and accomplice Michel Lelièvre kidnapped An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks, two teenage girls from [[Hasselt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.trouw.nl/home/steeds-vond-vader-marchal-een-woord~a1a22a15/|title=Steeds vond vader Marchal een woord|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Trouw]]|language=nl-NL|access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were on their way back to their holiday home in [[Westende]] following a night out in [[Blankenberge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/archive/an-et-eefje-jusqu-au-bout-de-l-horreur-51b88269e4b0de6db9a9d83b|title=An et Eefje, jusqu'au bout de l'horreur|date=|work=[[La Libre Belgique]]|access-date=24 June 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Lejeune and Russo already in the dungeon, Lambrecks and Marchal were kept chained up in a bedroom. In September, according to Martin, Lambrecks and Marchal were drugged and brought to [[Jumet]], where Dutroux and accomplice Bernard Weinstein killed them by burying them in a hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/belgique/an-et-eefje-enterrees-vivantes-sans-doute-en-septembre-95-51b882e5e4b0de6db9a9febf|title=An et Eefje enterrées vivantes, sans doute en septembre 95|date=|work=La Libre Belgique|access-date=26 June 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of Lambrecks and Marchal's deaths, Weinstein and a man named Philippe Divers stole a van and hid it in a hangar; after it was found there by the hangar's owner, it was taken away by the police. Dutroux and Weinstein suspected that Divers and his friend Pierre Rochow had betrayed them, and on the night of 4 November, wishing to interrogate them about the van, Dutroux and Weinstein lured Divers and Rochow into Weinstein's home in Jumet and drugged and sequestered them, before leaving to go to Rochow's house to search for clues about the van. There they found his girlfriend Bénédicte Jadot, whom they took with them back to Jumet and questioned before leaving again to pick up another person. While they were away, Jadot escaped and alerted a neighbour, who called the police.&lt;ref name="Je ne voulais pas les supprimer"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/belgique/je-ne-voulais-pas-les-supprimer-51b88369e4b0de6db9aa1f8d|title="Je ne voulais pas les supprimer"|date=|work=La Libre Belgique|access-date=26 June 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dhnet.be/actu/faits/dutroux-m-aurait-tuee-51b7ca7de4b0de6db98e5a1f|title=''Dutroux m'aurait tuée''|date=|work=[[La Dernière Heure]]|access-date=26 June 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Weinstein wanted by police, Dutroux decided to kill him to prevent his capture. He kidnapped Weinstein and held him in the dungeon at his house in Marcinelle between 13 and 20 November. During this time, he let Lejeune and Russo roam freely around the house. After feeding him food laced with [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]], Dutroux placed [[hose clamp]]s around Weinstein's testicles until Weinstein told him where his money was hidden. Dutroux then killed Weinstein by burying him in a hole on his (Dutroux's) property in [[Sars-la-Buissière]].&lt;ref name="La Dernière Heure"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dhnet.be/archive/bernard-weinstein-torture-avec-des-colliers-de-serrage-51b82fa2e4b0de6db9a061bc|title=Bernard Weinstein torturé avec des colliers de serrage|date=|work=La Dernière Heure|access-date=26 June 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, Dutroux, having been recognised by Rochow, was arrested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Dutroux and Martin, Lejeune and Russo were still alive in the house at the time of Dutroux's arrest in December, and Dutroux had ordered Martin to leave new food and water for the girls in the dungeon each time they ran out. Martin neglected to feed them, later claiming she was too afraid to go into the dungeon.&lt;ref name="Van Heeswyck 1999"&gt;Van Heeswyck, Marie-Jeanne; Bulté, Annemie; De Coninck, Douglas; ''The X-Dossiers'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Lejeune and Russo eventually starved to death. Dutroux initially stated that they were still alive when he returned home following his release from prison on 20 March 1996; according to him, Lejeune died that day, and Russo followed suit four days later despite his efforts to save her; during his trial, he said they were already dead when he returned from prison.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/belgique/langloisjulie-et-melissa-sont-mortes-de-faim-et-de-soif-51b882e5e4b0de6db9a9fe82|title=Langlois: "Julie et Mélissa sont mortes de faim et de soif"|date=|work=La Libre Belgique|access-date=27 June 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lesoir.be/archive/recup/le-calvaire-de-julie-et-melissa-martin-et-le-mystere-de_t-20040310-Z0P4PC.html|title=Le calvaire de Julie et Melissa Martin et le mystère de la lourde porte|date=|work=[[Le Soir]]|access-date=28 June 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; An expert asserted that they would not have been able to survive the entire time Dutroux was in prison on the total amount of food and water they were said to have been given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/nflb18032004_001|title=Julie en Melissa konden geen 103 dagen overleven|date=|work=[[De Standaard]]|access-date=27 June 2018|language=nl-BE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutroux buried Lejeune and Russo's bodies in the garden of the house he owned in Sars-la-Buissière, near to that of Weinstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nouvelobs.com/societe/20110510.OBS2805/dutroux-meurtrier-violeur-et-dealer-d-enfants.html|title=Dutroux, meurtrier, violeur et dealer d'enfants|last=|first=|date=|work=[[L'Obs]]|access-date=27 June 2018|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 28 May 1996, Dutroux and Lelièvre kidnapped 12-year-old [[Sabine Dardenne]], who was cycling to school in [[Tournai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dhnet.be/actu/faits/le-pedophile-dutroux-raconte-par-sabine-51b7d031e4b0de6db98fae63|title=Le pédophile Dutroux raconté par Sabine!|last=|first=|date=|work=La Dernière Heure|access-date=28 June 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a book originally published under the title ''J'avais 12 ans, j'ai pris mon vélo et je suis partie à l'école''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lesoir.be/archive/d-20050121-W2EC0U |title=Dutroux - Le livre s'arrache Sabine cartonne |language=fr |first=Marc |last=Metdepenningen |work=Le Soir |date=21 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (and published in the United Kingdom under the title ''I Choose to Live''), Dardenne described her time in captivity in Dutroux's Marcinelle home, where she spent most of the time imprisoned in the dungeon and was starved and repeatedly raped by Dutroux.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/may/15/biography.features1|title=Observer review: I Choose to Live by Sabine Dardenne|last=France|first=Louise|date=15 May 2005|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August, Dutroux and Lelièvre kidnapped 14-year-old Laetitia Delhez as she was walking home from her local swimming pool in [[Bertrix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/belgique/dutroux-et-lelievre-ont-prepare-l-enlevement-de-laetitia-51b882e5e4b0de6db9a9fee8|title=Dutroux et Lelièvre ont préparé l'enlèvement de Laetitia|last=Libre.be|first=La|access-date=28 June 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; An eyewitness observed Dutroux's van, described it and was able to identify part of the [[license plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtbf.be/info/dossier/l-affaire-dutroux-20-ans-plus-tard/detail_les-25-personnages-clefs-de-l-affaire-dutroux-les-2-temoins-de-bertrix?id=9370372|title=Les 25 personnages clefs de l'affaire Dutroux: les 2 témoins de Bertrix|date=9 August 2016|work=RTBF Info|access-date=28 June 2018|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August, Dutroux, Martin and Lelièvre were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3794985.stm |title=Timeline: Dutroux paedophile case |date=17 June 2004 |work=BBC News |access-date=11 August 2018 |language=en-GB }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/belgians-furious-as-child-killer-marc-dutrouxs-wife-michelle-martin-is-freed-8091716.html |title= Belgian furious as child killer Marc Dutroux wife Michelle is freed| agency= Associated Press| date= 22 August 2012| website= The Independent| accessdate= 12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An initial search of Dutroux's houses proved inconclusive, but two days later, Dutroux and Lelièvre both made confessions.

==Grave errors by law enforcement and prosecution during investigation==
===Failure to follow up on letter of Dutroux's mother warning of kidnapped girls being held at his house===
In 1995 Dutroux's mother wrote a letter to the authorities stating that she knew that Dutroux had kidnapped two girls and was keeping them at his house.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

===Failure to rescue Melissa and Julie===
After Melissa and Julie were kidnapped in 1995, it took police 14 months to arrest Dutroux even though he had been a prime suspect from the start and had committed similar crimes before.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Frenkiel |first1=Olenka |title=Belgium's silent heart of darkness |url=http://archive.is/rUKk6 |website=guardian.co.uk |publisher=the guardian |accessdate=8 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the search for Melissa and Julie, police visited Dutroux's house twice on 13 December and 19 December where Julie and Melissa were held. However, no attempts were made to free them, even though the locksmith who accompanied the police, René Michaux,&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; said that he heard screams of children coming from inside the house. The locksmith repeatedly said: "I'm not leaving before we turn the place upside down. The screams are clearly coming from inside the house." To which Michaux replied: "Who is the police officer here? You or me?"&lt;ref name="telegraphcover"/&gt;

===Dutroux arrest on car theft charges===
Around the time of Eefje Lambrecks and An Marchal's deaths, Weinstein and a man named Philippe Divers stole a van and hid it in a hangar; after it was found there by the hangar's owner, it was taken away by the police. Dutroux and Weinstein suspected that Divers and his friend Pierre Rochow had betrayed them, and on the night of 4 November, wishing to interrogate them about the van, Dutroux and Weinstein lured Divers and Rochow into Weinstein's home in Jumet and drugged and sequestered them, before leaving to go to Rochow's house to search for clues about the van. There they found his girlfriend Bénédicte Jadot, whom they took with them back to Jumet and questioned before leaving again to pick up another person. While they were away, Jadot escaped and alerted a neighbour, who called the police.&lt;ref name="Je ne voulais pas les supprimer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; With Weinstein wanted by police, Dutroux decided to kill him to prevent capture. He kidnapped Weinstein and held him in the dungeon at his house in Marcinelle between 13 and 20 November. During this time, he let Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo roam freely around the house. After feeding him food laced with [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]], Dutroux placed [[hose clamp]]s around Weinstein's testicles until Weinstein told him where his money was hidden. Dutroux then killed Weinstein by burying him in a hole on his (Dutroux's) property in [[Sars-la-Buissière]].&lt;ref name="La Dernière Heure"/&gt; In December, Dutroux, having been recognised by Rochow, was arrested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Marc Dutroux was arrested on 6 December 1995 on car theft charges and subsequently convicted to three months in jail.&lt;ref name="murderpedia"/&gt; During the three months Melissa and Julie died of starvation and dehydration in their dungeon cell as the wife of Dutroux didn't feed them, even though she knew that they were there.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

===Failure to review video tapes confiscated from Dutroux===
During the search of the houses of Marc Dutroux several video tapes were found. Those were never looked at. Some of them showed Dutroux constructing the dungeon in which Melissa and Julie were held. Had police looked at it, they would have found the dungeon and Melissa and Julie.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; The video tapes had been in possession of the police since December 1995. They had been passed on the to the prosecutors in the case but not to the judges.&lt;ref name="guardianvideo"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bates |first1=Stephan |title=Police admit Dutroux video bungle |url=http://archive.is/UjFPC |website=guardian.co.uk |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=8 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some of the video tapes were actually returned to Dutroux by police officer René Michauxm without ever being looked at.

The later leading investigator Michel Bourlet said that some of the video tapes had disappeared and that he want to have them all recovered and reviewed.&lt;ref name="dhnet"/&gt;

The videos were reportedly stolen after they were returned to Dutroux.&lt;ref name="dhnet"/&gt; In 1999 some of the tapes were finally reviewed. One of them showed Dutroux raping a young woman in Slovakia.&lt;ref name="dhnet"/&gt; The videos could have made it possible to identify other victims and also exactly determine the severity of the torture that the victims had to endure during their ordeal.&lt;ref name="dhnet"/&gt;

Later during the trial the lawyer of one of the victims, Laetitia Delhez, also expressed disappointment that the videos weren't reviewed, because they could have proved that Dutroux wasn't acting alone.&lt;ref name="dhnet"/&gt;

===Escape of Dutroux in 1998===
In 1998 Dutroux was allowed to have a look at his case files. He was accompanied by two police officers for that. When one officer went on a break Dutroux overwhelmed the other officer and was able to escape. He was captured a few hours later.&lt;ref name="telegraphcover"/&gt; The Minister of Justice [[Stefaan De Clerck]], the Minister of the Interior [[Johan Vande Lanotte]], and the police chief resigned as a result. In 2000, Dutroux received a five-year sentence for threatening a police officer during his escape. In 2002, he received another five-year sentence for unrelated crimes.&lt;ref name=murder /&gt;&lt;ref name="murderpedia"/&gt;

===Failure to analyse DNA from basement dungeon===
Thousands of hairs were found in the cellar dungeon where Melissa and Julie were held. However those were for a very long time not tested for DNA.&lt;ref name="telegraphcover"/&gt;

===Inquiry into officer De Baets handling of the police investigation===
An inquiry was initiated into the way the investigation was handled by officer De Baets. As this inquiry into his handling of the case took up a lot of resources and during the inquiry it wasn't possible for him to pass on information to the Parliamentary inquiry into the handling of the case, crucial time was lost.&lt;ref name="nytimesbook"/&gt;

There were accusations that language difficulties obscured the investigation. The testimony of Régina Louf was in Dutch, however it was reviewed several times by the new investigators who were primarily French speaking and they had difficulties in understanding her. Thus they changed the meaning of her testimony in a way that made her sound less credible.&lt;ref name="nytimesbook"/&gt;

===Failure to properly investigate leads to Slovakia and Czech Republic===
Several sources said that Michel Nihoul and Marc Dutroux were planning on a prostitution and trafficking operation between Slovakia, the Czech Republic and western Europe. Several pieces of evidence lead to connections to Slovakia and the Czech Republic. This included a video tape of Dutroux raping a young woman in Slovakia that wasn't reviewed after it was seized. It also included testimonies saying that they were planning on setting up a trafficking operation. Also the car theft and smuggling operation that Dutroux was involved in lead to those two Eastern European countries. During the time of his arrest Dutroux was in the possession of 2.000 SKK (Slovakian currency) in cash. Six Belgian investigators visited the Czech Republic and Slovakia in August 1996. It wasn't possible to proof that Dutroux had committed any crimes while being there. Thus they returned without any substantial evidence.&lt;ref name="kriminalistika"&gt;{{cite web |title=Marc Dutroux |url=http://kriminalistika.eu/muzeumzla/dutroux/dutroux.html |website=kriminalistika.eu |publisher=kriminalistika |accessdate=9 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of cover-up==
Many Belgian people believed that Dutroux was part of a paedophile network, that included high- ranking members of the Belgian establishment and that the other people involved were never prosecuted.&lt;ref name="telegraphcover"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Helm |first1=Toby |title=Belgium accused of cover-up in Dutroux inquiry |url=http://archive.is/LxSWS#selection-607.14-607.26 |website=telegraph.co.uk |publisher=telegraph |accessdate=8 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judge Jean-Marc Connerottes removal from the case===
Press reports claimed that before his removal judge Jean-Marc Connerotte was on the verge of publicly disclosing the names of high level government officials who had been recognized on video-tapes.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Judge Jean-Marc Connerotte had said that the business man Michel Nihoul was the brains behind the child kidnapping operation.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Investigators also believed that Dutroux and Nihoul were planning on a long-distance prostitution trafficking network involving cars and the import of girls from Slovakia.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

The investigating police said in 1996, that Dutroux was part of a child-prostitution ring, that may also have been responsible for several other disappearances still unsolved. They also said that the gang surround Dutroux offered $5.000 per girl they received. Their criminal activities also involved car theft.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt; It was said that the criminal network around Dutroux was involved in car theft and smuggling. The car in which Melissa and Julie were kidnapped has never been found. The general prosecutor, Anne Thilly, decided to have the car theft and smuggling be investigated by different police authorities in different parts of the country. In this way it was nearly impossible to investigate the connection between the car theft, kidnapping and human trafficking.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Dutroux also said that Nihoul had proposed to traffic girls from Eastern countries.&lt;ref name="consortiumnews"/&gt;

Michel Lelièvre the accomplice of Marc Dutroux said that the two girls Melissa and Julie were kidnapped as an order by a third party. However while in arrest Lelièvre stopped cooperating with the authorities.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; He told police that he had been threatened and couldn't risk saying any more.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Frenkiel |first1=Olenka |title=Dutroux and the network|url= https://archive.is/amK88|website=washingtonpost.com |publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The father of Melissa Russo, Gino Russo, said during the White March that the removal of judge Connerotte was like "''spitting on the grave of Julie and Melissa''." Russo subsequently said that after Connerotte was removed there was no progress in the investigation.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

===Dutrouxs wealth and assets===
Dutroux owned ten houses. He was in total worth 6 million [[Belgian franc|Belgian Francs]] (130,000 [[United States dollar|USD]]).&lt;ref name="nytimesbook"/&gt; While he had all of this wealth in property he also received public assistance of $1.200 a month. It isn't clear how Dutroux was able to acquire the ten properties. Documents were released by Wikileaks that show that large sums of money in different currencies arrived in Michelle Martins bank account timely linked to the disappearances of the abducted girls.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt; The money was also transferred in foreign currencies from Morocco and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="consortiumnews"/&gt; Both the transfers and the value of the six properties that Dutroux owned suggested to investigators that he was financed by a larger pedophile and prostitution ring.&lt;ref name="nytimesbook"/&gt; The Flemish newspaper Nieuwsblad reported that he had committed health insurance fund fraud, theft, insurance fraud and investments on the stock market and that that had contributed to his wealth.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dutroux had zijn lesje geleerd |url=https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/hno19022004_049 |website=nieuwsblad.be |publisher=Nieuwsblad |accessdate=9 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other outlets suggested that he was able to acquire his wealth through criminal activity such as drug-trafficking and insurance fraud.&lt;ref name="murderpedia"/&gt; Additional sources said that he made a lot of money with car theft and pimping.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jenkins |first1=John Philip |title=Marc Dutroux |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marc-Dutroux |website=britannica.com |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=9 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims by the victims families===
The father of one of the murdered girls, Paul Marchal, the father of An Marchal accused the police and the judicial system of a cover-up in 2001. He was angry that still in 2001 the trial hadn't started even though Dutroux had already been under arrest for several years. Paul Marchal said: "''It feels like they don't want to find the truth. It is not a good feeling and not only I think this''."&lt;ref name="telegraphcover"/&gt;

Carine Russo and her husband Gino Russo were not permitted to identify her daughter and look at her body. They were told by authorities that Dutroux had identified her and that that was enough.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; The autopsy of Melissa showed that she had been raped repeatedly over a prolonged period of time. No DNA evidence was taken from the body to conclusively make sure that only Dutroux had raped her. Dutroux always denied raping Melissa and Julie.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

Eventually several families of victims boycotted the official trial stating that it was a circus and there had been no progress in the case since the removal of judge Connerottes.&lt;ref name="telegraphmurder"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Evans-Pritchard |first1=Ambrose |title=Judge tells of murder plots to block Dutroux investigation |url=http://archive.is/imzXd |website=telegraph.co.uk |publisher=telegraph |accessdate=9 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failure to test hairs in the dungeon for DNA evidence===
There were countless hairs found in the dungeon where the two girls were held. The judge Langlois refused to have them tested for DNA evidence even though the leading police investigator Michel Bourlet had begged him to have them analyzed in order to know whether more people aside from Dutroux were involved.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; The general prosecutor of the case, Anne Thily, said that she didn't believe that there was anyone else involved and thus didn't have the samples analyzed.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Thily told investigative journalist Frenkiel that: "''In any case the hairs have all now been analysed - all 5,000.' And the results of this analysis? Nothing. No evidence of any relevance in the Dutroux affair. Which proves, of course, that Langlois was right all along''." But according to Frenkiel this wasn't true. Sources central to the investigation confirmed that in 2002 the hairs had still not been analysed. Thus Frenkiel accused the senior prosecutor Thily of lying brasantly.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Frenkiel continued to question Thily and asked her how she would want to prove that Dutroux raped the girls, as he was denying it and there was no DNA evidence. Thily then replied that there were DNA tests, but that the results came back inconclusive as the bodies were too decomposed at the time the samples were taken.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Dutroux's lawyer, Xavier Magnee, said during the trial proceedings "I speak not only as a lawyer, but also as a citizen and father. He was not the only devil. Out of the 6.000 hair samples that were found in the basement cellar where some of the victims were held, 25 "unknown" DNA profiles were discovered. There were people in that cellar that are not now accused." However it was never attempted by the prosecution to match those DNA profiles to people implicated in the case. .&lt;ref name="independentpolicehelp"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Castle|first1=Stephen|title=Dutroux says he abducted girls with police help|url=http://archive.is/jUDPQ#selection-3877.0-3877.47|website=independent |publisher=Independent |accessdate=8 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnee also said that the prosecutors didn’t follow up on evidence leading to a cult called "Abrasax", which allegedly performed human sacrifices.&lt;ref name="independentpolicehelp"/&gt; In a wooden house of Bernard Weinstein (accomplice of Dutroux) a letter was found from the occult sect "Abrasax", in which a gift for the high priestress (Dominique Kindermans)&lt;ref name="irishtimes"&gt;{{cite web |last1=LOVELL |first1=JEREMY |title=Police raid centre of satanic sect |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/police-raid-centre-of-satanic-sect-1.118865 |website=irishtimes.com |publisher=irish times |accessdate=1 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; was mentioned consisting of 17 girls between the age of 2 and 20 for anal, oral and vaginal sex. It was signed by priest "Anubis". This priest was later identified as Francis Desmedt. Later investigations showed that four police men in Charleroi were also members of the sect, one was even the treasurer.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite web |title=KINDESMISSBRAUCH "Kleine blonde Pferdchen" |url=https://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-8680123.html |website=spiegel.de |publisher=spiegel |accessdate=1 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarter of the sect (Institut Abrasax) in Rue Emile Vandervelde 223 Forchies La Marche was raided in 1996 by 150 officers. The television showed police taking away bags of papers, video cassettes and a refrigerator. They also took away black magic ritual implements and human skulls.&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt;

===Removal of police officers from the case===
Several police officer that had worked on the case were subsequently removed in 1997. They were reportedly removed because they had manipulated evidence surrounding the testimony of Régina Louf. However the involved officers always denied that accusation. This included officer Rudi Hoskens, who believed that the testimony of witness X1, Régina Louf, was true because her testimony matched an unsolved murder case that she could have had no knowledge on, had she not witnessed it. What she described was the murder of then 15 year old Christine van Hees. She said that the girl was tortured to death by the group and that Nihoul took part in the torture. She said Dutroux watched. Christine's body was found in 1984.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; The officer leading the investigation, Mr. De Baets, said that they followed up on all testimonies the X witnesses had given, in order to determine whether what they said was possible or not and that they came to the conclusion that it was possible that the things had occurred as the witnesses described them. As this took up a lot of resources and time of the police force an inquiry was initiated into the handling of the case, which then again took up as much resources as the investigation of Mr. De Baets itself. It was said that: "''The suspicion grew that De Baets and others formed part of a sect bent on destabilising the kingdom''." So De Baets and large parts of his team were removed from the investigation and sent home on indefinite leave.&lt;ref name="nytimesbook"/&gt; Not only was De Baets dropped from the investigation, he was also charged in 1997 with concealing the fact that Louf had wrongly identified the photograph of one of the victims. However, on the video tapes of her interrogation it is visible that it was very hard for her to stand looking at the photographs and that her right answer had been in the files all along. In 1999 De Baets was exhonerated from the charges.&lt;ref name="nytimesbook"/&gt; Additionally two journalists from Le Soir Illustre, who had defamed him and four colleagues were convicted to pay two of them 55.000 $ plus court costs.&lt;ref name="nytimesbook"/&gt; Even though De Baets had been exhonerated, he and his colleagues remained on leave.&lt;ref name="nytimesbook"/&gt;

===Promotion of René Michaux, who failed to save Julie and Melissa===
The officer that searched Dutrouxs house while Julie and Melissa were likely still alive on 13 and 19 December 1995. However even though the locksmith that he inspected the house with suggested they should search the whole house to find out where children's screams were coming from, Michaux left after not having searched the house thoroughly.&lt;ref name="dhnet"&gt;{{cite web |title=Procès Dutroux: Michaux à la barre |url=http://archive.is/MTgi4 |website=dhnet.be |accessdate=9 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Not only did Michaux fail to rescue Julie and Melissa, he also failed to look at video tapes that were confiscated from Dutroux's house. Those video tapes showed him constructing the dungeon, which would have led them to the place where Julie and Melissa were kept. Some of the videos also included tapes of Dutroux raping women. Many of the tapes were returned to Dutroux without ever being looked at by law enforcement.&lt;ref name="dhnet"/&gt;

Even though René Michaux committed grave failures in his duty as a police officer in what was one of the most important criminal cases in the history of Belgium, he was never removed or put on leave like other officers had been. He was subsequently promoted to the position of police commissioner.&lt;ref name="consortiumnews"/&gt;

===Arrests of law enforcement personal believed to be connected to Dutroux===
At least seven members of law enforcement were arrested on suspicion of having ties to Marc Dutroux. One of them was Georges Zico a police detective believed to be an associate of Dutroux.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brace |first1=Matthew |title=Detective held in Belgian abuse case |url=http://archive.is/fUnKU#selection-4279.0-4279.12 |website=independent |publisher=Independent |accessdate=8 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to prosecutor Michel Bourlet, Zico was charged with truck theft, document forgery and insurance fraud.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

===Judge Van Espens close ties to suspect Michel Nihoul===
The judge presiding of the Dutroux case, Judge Van Espen, had a close relationship to Michel Nihoul. A journalist revealed that as a lawyer Nihoul had represented the wife of Nihoul. Van Espens sister was the godmother of Nihouls child. However even though his close friend Michel Nihoul was involved in the case, Van Espen never resigned. He was also not removed from the case for a very long time. Even though judge Conerotte had been removed simply for attending a fundraising dinner.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Van Espen was further more the judge presiding over the murder case of Christine van Hees from 1984. He only resigned from this case in 1998 when Nihoul was accused of being involved in the murder and van Espens close ties to Nihoul were revealed.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

===Testimony of judge Jean-Marc Connerottes in court===
Judge Connerottes testified in the Dutroux case on 4 March 2004. He broke down in the witness box stating that there had been high-level murder plots to stop his investigation into the child-sex mafia. He stated that he had to drive in bullet-proof cars and had armed guards around him at all times because shadowy figures from the crime world were threatening him. The police had informed him that murder contracts had been taken out against the prosecutors in the case. He alleged that organised crime methods were used to discredit his work and make sure that the investigation would end in a judicial failure.&lt;ref name="telegraphmurder"/&gt;

Connerottes criticised authorities for not rescuing Julie and Melissa even though Dutroux had been a prime suspect for one year before they were found dead. The judge also said that he had received files describing a child-sex network. It described seizure of children and foreign trafficking. The sum of 150.000 Francs was mentioned as the price for a girl.&lt;ref name="telegraphmurder"/&gt; Connerottes also said that he was doubtful about the official explanation on how Julie and Melissa died. It was said that they starved to death in the dungeon. An adult can last about three days without water and maximum 60 days without food. If they received nothing to drink and eat they should have been dead very soon after Dutroux was imprisoned. However Michelle Martin insisted that they were still alive when he returned.&lt;ref name="telegraphmurder"/&gt; Connerottes had even written to King Albert in 1996 stating that his investigations into crime networks were being blocked because suspects "received serious protection". The judge said that the "dysfunctional judiciary" was breaking down as mafia groups took secret control of the "key institutions of the country".&lt;ref name="telegraphmurder"/&gt;

===Letter of judge Jean-Marc Connerottes to King Albert II===
A letter of juge Connerottes addressed to King Albert II in 1996 stated: ''"This institution seems to acquire its authority and supremacy over sectors of the justice system by relying on a complex and secret modus operandi, that of the appropriation of certain key circuits of our institutions created and regulated by the Law. It is a matter essentially of political, financial, police, and media circuits. This mafia-style criminal phenomenon is evidently not peculiar to Belgium, but it involves particular manifestations that are well suited to this small country. We can imagine the obstacles that a judiciary inquiry will meet when investigating such facts: numerous taboos, problems of mentality, and a lack of cultural reference on the issue in order to be able to become aware of or deal with such criminal phenomena, taking advantage in Belgium of official reticence in terms of their acknowledgement, which favours or supports their occultation. The function of a criminal system of this sort is obviously to serve its fundamental purpose, the pursuance of particularly profitable illicit activities, such as money-laundering, and to protect the ‘legitimacy’ of its activities and the impunity of its agents. This indispensable function corresponds to the motive of criminal protection that assures the permanency of the incriminated system by means of the infiltration of the certain circuits of our institutions, especially the police force, a veritable ‘knot’ which my whole investigation has come up against."''&lt;ref name="infrakshun"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jean Michel Nihoul |url=https://infrakshun.wordpress.com/tag/jean-michel-nihoul/ |website=infrakshun.wordpress.com |publisher=Infrakshun |accessdate=9 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book by chairman of the parliamentary inquiry Marc Verwilghen===
Marc Verwilghen, the chairman of the parliamentary inquiry into the handling of the Dutroux case, reported attempts in a book he published in 1999 to stifle their investigation into how the case had been handled. Verwilghen eventually published a book which claimed that the commission’s findings had been muzzled by political and judicial leaders to prevent the revelation of details which would have implicated the complicity of additional perpetrators. Mr Verwilghen claimed that senior political and legal figures refused to cooperate with the inquiry. He said magistrates and police were officially told to refuse to answer certain questions, in what he described as 'a characteristic smothering operation'. Verwilghen blamed Mr Langlois for refusing to hand over evidence of official protection for Mr Dutroux. He said that if they had received that information, their report would have been without doubt more precise and detailed. Verwilghen added that for him, the Dutroux affair was a question of organised crime.&lt;ref name="guardianverwilghen"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bates |first1=Stephen |title=Cover-up claims revive sex scandal |url=http://archive.is/HNJHi#selection-1095.30-1095.252 |website=theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=9 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statements by senator Anne-Marie Lizin===
The Belgian senator Anne-Marie Lizin commented on the case saying: "''Stupidity (by the police) can't be the only explanation. It's a question of stupidity, incompetence and corruption. Dutroux must be a friend of somebody important. Or else he was being protected because he was known to be a police informant''." Lizin said Dutroux was not a true pedophile, as he has been portrayed. He had a record of dealing in stolen cars, selling arms to hoodlums and trafficking in prostitution. ''"When he discovered that men paid a lot more for little girls for prostitution, he started kidnapping them,"'' she said. When Dutroux finally was arrested, police found in his house video films of him raping little girls. They said he did this so he could sell the films to pedophiles''.''&lt;ref name="chicagotribune"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Moseley |first1=Ray |title=Child Sex Case Adds Outrage To Scandals Rocking Belgium |url=http://archive.is/BOLXi |website=chicagotribune.com |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=9 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempts to have access to Dutroux Dossier from Wikileaks blocked in Belgium===
In 2009 Wikileaks published the Dutroux Dossier. Belgian authorities tried to have the dossier taken down. The prosecutor general of Liege, Cedric Visart de Bocarme, said “''There is some true, some false, some very disparate information here, involving some people who have done nothing wrong, who have simply been mentioned in an investigation and are thus exposed to public contempt, whereas all this material should have remained classified.''”&lt;ref name="australian"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Charter |first1=David |title=WikiLeaks slammed over publishing dossier including Belgian pedophile killer Marc Dutroux|url=http://archive.is/AyIhz|website=telegraph.co.uk |publisher=The Australian |accessdate=8 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 20 potential witnesses of the case have died with no explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/05/dutroux.featuresreview|title=Belgium's silent heart of darkness|last=Frenkiel|first=Olenka|date=5 May 2002|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|access-date=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Abrasax sect with members working at the police force in Charleroi===

In a wooden house of Bernard Weinstein (accomplice of Dutroux) a letter was found from the occult sect "Abrasax", in which a gift for the high priestress (Dominique Kindermans)&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt; was mentioned consisting of 17 girls between the age of 2 and 20 for anal, oral and vaginal sex. It was signed by priest "Anubis". This priest was later identified as Francis Desmedt. Later investigations showed that four police men in Charleroi were also members of the sect, one was even the treasurer.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; The headquarter of the sect (Institut Abrasax) in Rue Emile Vandervelde 223 Forchies La Marche was raided in 1996 by 150 officers. The television showed police taking away bags of papers, video cassettes and a refrigerator. They also took away black magic ritual implements and human skulls.&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt;

== Parliamentary investigation and escape from custody ==
A 17-month investigation by a parliamentary commission into the Dutroux affair produced a report in February 1998, which concluded that while Dutroux did not have accomplices in high positions in the police and justice systems, as he continued to claim, he profited from [[political corruption|corruption]], sloppiness and incompetence.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

==Public outcry==
In October 1996 more than 300.000 Belgians marched through the streets of Brussels after the beloved judge Jean-Marc Connerotte was removed from the case. He was removed for attending a fundraising dinner for the families of the victims, which the court system claimed damaged his impartiality.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; They demanded an investigation and reform of the police and justice system. The protest was called the "[[White March]]".&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraphcover"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reuters |title=275,000 in Belgium Protest Handling of Child Sex Scandal |url=http://archive.is/SFRGD |website=nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=8 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Jean- Marc Connerotte was beloved by the public because the only two surviving victims were rescued on his initiative, which made him a national hero.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Protesters were wearing signs that said "Stop the cover-up".&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

To protest the prospect of a conditional release of Marc Dutroux, a "Black March" was organised on the 23rd anniversary of the historic "[[White March]]" protest that was held in Brussels on 20 October 1996. The calls to take part in the march were made after it was made public that a court had approved the request of Michel Lelièvre for conditional release, who was an accomplice of Dutroux and had received a 25-year sentence.&lt;ref name="brusselstimes"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Galindo |first1=Gabriela |title=‘Black march’ to denounce conditional release of serial child killer Dutroux’s accomplice |url=https://www.brusselstimes.com/all-news/belgium-all-news/justice-belgium/71010/black-march-to-denounce-release-of-serial-child-killer-dutrouxs-accomplice/ |website=bruseelstimes.com |publisher=The Brussels Times |accessdate=3 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guardian reported in 2004 that "''the entire credibility of the current reformist government of Guy Verhofstadt and Belgium's very reputation as a normal civilised country is on the line.''"&lt;ref name="guardianhaunted"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Osborn |first1=Andrew |title=Belgium still haunted by paedophile scandal |url=http://archive.is/glp1s#selection-1187.0-1187.337 |website=theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=9 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination of André Cools===
The assassination of [[André Cools]] took place in 1991. The revelations in the Cools case coincided with the revelations in the Dutroux case and in total made the Belgian public lose trust in their government. Van der Biest was eventually convicted but had already been investigated five years prior as the one who ordered the contract hi on Cools. Due to failures in the investigation he wasn't charged. It was found that several Belgian politicians had been bribed with large sums of money by an Italian helicopter manufacturer, Agusta-Dassault, in exchange for military contracts. This included Belgian secretary general of NATO, [[Willy Claes]]. There were allegations that both the assassination of André Cools and the case surrounding Dutroux showed that organised crime had spread in Belgium and that the institutions weren't efficient in combatting the spread or corruption and organised crime.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;

==Trial==
Dutroux's trial began on 1 March 2004, some seven and a half years after his initial arrest.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/dutroux-trial-to-revive-belgium-s-trauma-1.1133525|title=Dutroux trial to revive Belgium's trauma|date=1 March 2004|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[jury trial|trial by jury]] and up to 450 people were called upon to testify. The trial took place in [[Arlon]], the capital of the [[Luxembourg (province of Belgium)|Belgian province of Luxembourg]], where the investigations had started. Dutroux was tried for the murders of An Marchal, Eefje Lambrecks and Bernard Weinstein. While admitting the abductions, he denied all three killings, although he had earlier confessed to killing Weinstein.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com1"/&gt; Dutroux was also charged with a host of other crimes: [[auto theft]], [[Kidnapping|abduction]], [[attempted murder]] and attempted abduction, [[child molestation|molestation]], and three unrelated rapes of women from [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kriminalistika.eu/muzeumzla/dutroux/dutroux.html Marc Dutroux] at Kriminalstika.eu. Retrieved 12 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was tried as an accomplice, as were Lelièvre and [[:nl:Michel Nihoul|Michel Nihoul]]. To protect the accused, they were made to sit in a glass cage during the trial. In the first week of the trial, photos of Dutroux's face were not allowed to be printed in Belgian newspapers for privacy reasons; this ban remained in force until 9 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Siuberski|first=Phillipe|title=Dutroux lashes out at media|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/09/1078594307568.html|newspaper=The Age|date=9 March 2004|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the trial, Dutroux continued to insist that he was part of a Europe-wide [[paedophile]] ring with accomplices among police officers, businessmen, doctors, and even high-level Belgian politicians.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-21498535|title=Belgium court denies Marc Dutroux release|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a rare move, the [[jury]] at the [[Court of assizes (Belgium)|assizes trial]] publicly protested the presiding judge Stéphane Goux's handling of the debates and the victims' testimonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.humanite.fr/node/304250 |newspaper=l'Humanité|title=Procès Dutroux.

Verdicts were returned on 17 June 2004 after three days of deliberation.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/belgian-paedophile-dutroux-guilty-of-rape-and-murder-1.1145387|title=Belgian paedophile Dutroux guilty of rape and murder|date=18 June 2004|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutroux, Martin and Lelièvre were found guilty on all charges; the jury were unable to reach a verdict on Nihoul's role.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"/&gt;

===Dutroux's testimony===
Dutroux claimed that he was a low dog in a powerful pedophile network. He further claimed that Michel Nihoul was the organizer of their abductions."&lt;ref name="guardingdungeondeath"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Black |first1=Ian |title=Dutroux boasts of dungeon of death |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/04/dutroux.ianblack |website=theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=8 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he did torture and abuse all of the girls but denied killing any of them until the very end.&lt;ref name="telegraphkill"/&gt; Dutroux further denied the kidnapping, raping and murdering Melissa and Julie. He however admitted to incarcerating them at one of his houses.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; On the case of Melissa and Julie Dutroux also claimed that he had "protected them from a power and sinister child sex ring."&lt;ref name="guardiandungeondeath"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Black |first1=Ian |title=Dutroux boasts of dungeon of death |url=http://archive.is/z2BV4 |website=theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=8 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; His testimony that he never raped Julie and Melissa was somewhat supported by examinations of psychiatrists in 1996 stating that Dutroux didn't fit the pedophile profile. He wasn't attracted to children. But might have chosen to abduct younger victims because they were easier to manipulate and control.&lt;ref name="murderpedia"/&gt;
{{check quotation}}
Dutroux admitted to abduction and rape of the other girls. He also admitted to burying his accomplice, Bernard Weinstein, alive for ''"letting the girls die.''"&lt;ref name="telegraphburied"/&gt; Dutroux further said that two unidentified policemen had taken part with him in the kidnapping of An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks.&lt;ref name="guardiandungeondeath"/&gt; He boasted about having build the dungeon in which An and Eefje were held for a while. He said: ''"I wanted to create a hiding place to spare them from being sent to a prostitution ring."'' Dutroux admitted to raping Eefje. He said that Weinstein had raped An. He also admitted to drugging both of them. Dutroux also admitted that he kidnapped Sabine Dardenne and raped her. He also admitted to kidnapping and raping Lateita Delhez but not handing them over to Nihoul ‘’"to spare them the fate of An and Eefje."’’&lt;ref name="guardiandungeondeath"/&gt; Dutrouxs lawyer, Xavier Magnee, repeatedly said that the prosecution never followed up on evidence of a network surrounding Dutroux.&lt;ref name="telegraphburied"/&gt;

===Michelle Martins testimony===
Martin testified that Dutroux and Weinstein kidnapped Melissa and Julia.&lt;ref name="guardiandungeondeath"/&gt; She also said that Dutroux had told her that he had murdered Weinstein.&lt;ref name="guardiandungeondeath"/&gt; Martin further said that Dutroux and Weinstein had killed An and Eefje.&lt;ref name="guardiandungeondeath"/&gt; She further testified that Melissa and Julie starved to death in their basement in 1996 while Dutroux was in jail. She claims, that she was too scared to descend to the basement.&lt;ref name="guardiandungeondeath"/&gt;

Martin said that Dutroux had already decided to abduct girls in 1985. He had said that it was easier to abduct and rape girls than having to start affairs with them. This way he would also have more resources and time to spend on her. So she had to help him with the abductions.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad"/&gt;

===The X files===
The X files were testimonies of people who claimed to have been victims of Marc Dutroux. They had been created after judge Jean-Marc Connerotte had made a public appeal for victims to come forward. In total at least ten victims subsequently contacted the police. All of the witnesses were given the code name "X number". One of the witnesses names, namely X1, was revealed to be [[Regina Louf|Régina Louf]].&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; X1 said that from the age of 11/12 onwards a family friend named Tony Van den Bogaert took her to sex parties with the approval of her family. Several witnesses and family members of Louf confirmed that she had a sexual relationship with Tony Van den Bogaert starting from at least age 12. However Tony Van den Bogaert has never been interrogated, charged or convicted for sexual abuse. She claimed that other minors were present at the sex parties and that those were secretly filmed for [[blackmail]] purposes. She said: ''"It was highly organised. Big business. Blackmail. There was a lot of money involved."'' During her testimony she described some regular clients including judges, a prominent politician and one banker. She gave the police names, addresses and detailed description of two murders that matched unsolved cases of the two murders of teenage girls. Louf said that the parties didn't only include sex but also sadism, torture and murder. She claimed that one of the organisers of the parties was a man she knew as Mich (Jean Michel Nihoul). Louf described him as a cruel man, who sadistically tortured girls.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

Louf said that Marc Dutroux was at that time a young man who brought drugs to the parties for the girls to numb themselves and took care of them in other ways. As a reward he was also allowed to use them for his pleasure.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; The crimes that Louf described took place about ten years prior to the arrest of Dutroux.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Régina Loufs full name was leaked to the press. She was subsequently made out to look like a fantasist and liar.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; The new presiding judges declared that she was not a credible witness and that her testimony and the testimony of the other X witnesses would not be used during the trial.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

One of the other X witnesses, who's real name wasn't revealed, but who's now working for the police said that they had witnessed and experienced similar abuse. They also recounted instances where children were chased through the woods with Dobermans.&lt;ref name="nytimesbook"/&gt;

Witness X3 testified that one of the people present at the gatherings that involved sex orgies with minors, torture and murder was [[Willy Claes]], secretary general of the NATO. Claes resigned after he was found guilty of corruption in a tendering process for a large defence contract connected to [[Agusta scandal|Agusta helicopters]], a large military-helicopter producer from Italy.&lt;ref name="nytimesbook"/&gt;

The testimony of X2 implicated that [[Etienne Davignon]], [[Maurice Lippens (politician)|Maurice Lippens]], [[Paul Vanden Boeynants]], [[Benoît de Bonvoisin|Benoit de Bonvoisin]] and Prince Alexandre of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha were named as having been present at orgies involving underaged persons.&lt;ref name="infrakshun"/&gt;

A book was published in November 1999 titled: "''The X-Files: What Belgium Was Not Supposed to Know About the Dutroux Affair''." It was written by two journalist from the Flemish Belgian newspaper [[De Morgen]], Annemie Bulte and Douglas De Coninck and another journalist from the French Belgian newspaper Journal du Mardi, Marie-Jeanne Van Heeswyck. It claimed that the X witnesses were much more believable than stated by the media. But it also stated that there had been substantial efforts by the magistrates and senior police officials to demolish the testimony of the X-witnesses. The father of a police officer that was murdered while investigating a car smuggling ring, Judge Guy Poncelet, said that the book was brilliant and convincing. He said he believed that crucial evidence had been down played by the authorities.&lt;ref name="nytimesbook"&gt;{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Barry |title=Belgium Pedophilia Scandal /Did Authorities Cover Up Its Scope?: Book Revives Fear of Grand Conspiracy |url=http://archive.is/Evfkk#selection-2115.96-2115.114 |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=8 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentencing===
The [[Capital punishment in Belgium|death penalty]] was abolished in Belgium in 1996. The last execution for common-law crimes was in 1918. However, the majority of Belgians, at the time of the trial, would have had no problem with Dutroux receiving the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/buitenland/niet-alle-vragen-over-marc-dutroux-zijn-beantwoord~a691596/ |newspaper=Die Volkskrant |title=Niet alle vragen over Marc Dutroux zijn beantwoord|trans-title=Not all questions about Marc Dutroux are answered|first1=Bart |last1=Dirks|date= 1 March 2004|access-date=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June 2004, Dutroux received the maximum sentence of [[life imprisonment]], while Martin received 30 years and Lelièvre 25 years. The jury was asked to go back into seclusion to decide whether or not Nihoul was an accomplice.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

On 23 June, Dutroux lodged an appeal against his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belgium's Dutroux 'lodges appeal'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3834499.stm|publisher=BBC News (BBC)|date=23 June 2004|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Nihoul was [[acquittal|acquitted]] of [[kidnapping]] and [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charges, he was convicted on drug-related charges and was sentenced to five years imprisonment. Nihoul was released in spring 2006. He resided in [[Zeebrugge]] until his death on 23 October 2019.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

On 19 August 2012, about 2000 people in Brussels demonstrated against Martin's possible early release from prison. She has since been [[parole]]d, 13 years into her sentence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belgians demand pedophile accomplice stays in jail |date=19 August 2012 |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2012/08/19/4739041/belgians-demand-pedophile-accomplice.html |work=Sacbee News }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released into the care of the [[Poor Clares]] in [[Malonne]]. She was given shelter, although she was not part of the community. The sisters have declared that they were not her guardian and shelter was given under the condition that she would not violate the conditions of her parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ad.nl/buitenland/michelle-martin-onherkenbaar-veranderd~abff3872/ |title='Michelle Martin onherkenbaar veranderd' |trans-title=Michelle Martin irrecognisably changed|date= 30 April 2014|newspaper=Algemeen Dagblad|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the convent has since been sold, she has had to find new shelter or go back to prison. A former judge has created an apartment in his converted farmhouse, where she now lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/binnenland/2.31353 Article on the website] of Belgian television and radiostation [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]] (in Dutch): Michelle Martin moves to ex-judge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://brandpunt.kro-ncrv.nl/brandpunt/oud-rechter-neemt-ex-vrouw-dutroux-in-huis-ik-heb-ruimte-genoeg/ Website article relating to a Dutch TV program (in Dutch)], TV program about the judge who has given Michelle Martin shelter in his converted farm&lt;/ref&gt;

Lelièvre is currently serving his prison sentence in the prison of [[Ittre]]. His application for parole in 2013 was denied.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} He has since then been granted temporary leave, but has violated the conditions of release. He may be released if he can find an apprenticeship as a cabinet-maker, which has so far been unsuccessful. The Belgian state was forced to pay Lelièvre 6000 [[euro]]s. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that a moral compensation was in order because he was held in custody (nearly eight years) without receiving answers to his requests.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

On 4 February 2013, Dutroux requested the court in Brussels for an early release from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marc Dutroux: Child Killer Wants Early Release| url=http://news.sky.com/story/1047478/marc-dutroux-child-killer-wants-early-release|publisher=Sky News (BSkyB)|date=4 February 2013|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He insisted that he was "no longer dangerous" and wanted to be released into [[house arrest]] with an electronic tag ([[Electronic tagging|ankle bracelet]]) placed upon him. On 18 February, the court denied his request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belgium court denies Marc Dutroux release|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-21498535|work=BBC News|date=18 February 2013|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michel Nihoul===
Michel Nihoul was a business man that was known to frequently attend sex parties. He was accused of being the brains behind the child kidnapping and abuse operation around Dutroux.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Nihoul was charged in relation to the case with "kidnapping, rape, conspiracy and drug offenses."&lt;ref name="consortiumnews"/&gt;
Nihouls lawyer in the case was, Frederic Clement de Clety. His lawyer denied all charged made against Nihoul by Dutroux and called him a ‘’"liar and manipulator."’’&lt;ref name="guardiandungeondeath"/&gt; When the investigative journalist, Olenka Frenkiel, met Nihoul in Brussels he reportedly greeted her with the words "I am the monster of Belgium." He told her that he was certain that he would never be prosecuted. During the encounter he grabbed her, tickled her and pulled her unto him so that she called for her colleagues to help her get away from him. Frenkiel was working on a documentary on the case for the BBC.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

===Judges===
* Jean-Marc Connerotte (on his initiative two girls were rescued, was removed from case for attending fundraising dinner for families)
* Judge Jacques Langlois (investigating magistrate). Dutroux case was his first assignment&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;
* Stephane Goux (judge presiding over verdict)&lt;ref name="telegraphkill"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Evans-Pritchard |first1=Ambrose |title=Why didn't you kill me, child rape victim asks Dutroux |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belarus/1459791/Why-didnt-you-kill-me-child-rape-victim-asks-Dutroux.html |website=telegraph.co.uk |publisher=telegraph |accessdate=8 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Judge Van Espen (was in charge of the murder investigation of Christine van Hees, resigned from the Dutroux case and the murder investigation around van Hees after his close ties to Michel Nihoul were made public in 1998)

==Effects in Belgium==
The Dutroux case is so infamous that more than a third of Belgians with the surname "Dutroux" applied to have their surname changed between 1996 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Belgian paedophile's namesakes change surnames | date=10 January 1998 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/46398.stm | work =BBC News | accessdate = 10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dutroux's houses==
Marc Dutroux owned seven houses, four of which he used for his kidnappings:
*The house on the Route de Philippeville 128 in [[Marcinelle]] is most often cited in the media. All victims were held captive here in the basement and bedroom. The municipality of [[Charleroi]] seized ownership of this house, because of what happened there and the bad state of the house. There are plans to create an open space with a memorial site here. In the Belgian procedure of [[compulsory purchase]], an owner has a last right to visit a house. Therefore, Dutroux visited this house on 10 September 2009, under heavy police guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=4H2F1V1A&amp;subsection=3 |title= Dutroux nog één keer naar huis|

*A house in [[Jumet]], that has since been demolished. The remains of An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks were found buried in the garden of this house. Bernard Weinstein lived in this house for a while. A small monument is placed at this location.
*A house in [[Marchienne-au-Pont]]. Julie Lejeune and Mélissa Russo were held captive here for a short while after their kidnapping.
*A house in [[Sars-la-Buissière]]. The bodies of Lejeune, Russo and Weinstein were found buried in the garden. The house was bought by the municipality of [[Lobbes]] in the first months of 2009. It is planned to make a park with a monument commemorating Dutroux's victims here.

He declares to have spent hours discussing repentance and regret with him, which Dutroux does not have: He finds it regrettable that people have died, but he does not feel guilty. As a psychopath, he cannot empathize with what he does to others, he only sees what he is entitled to .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=DMF20120914_196 Advocaat wist niet dat Dutroux aanvraag voor enkelband indiende], www.standaard.be, 14 september 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martin Dumollard''' (June 22, 1810 in [[Tramoyes]] − March 8, 1862 in [[Montluel]]) was a French [[serial killer]] condemned to the [[guillotine]] after having been arrested and charged with the deaths of maids from 1855 to 1861. His victims were approached in [[Lyon]] by Dumollard, who offered them a nice house in Côtière. Convinced, they would eventually follow him and, during their wanderings on foot, he attacked them. All twelve assaults or attempted assaults occurred in the late 1850s and early 1860s until that of Marie Pichon on May 28, 1861. He was quickly arrested, along with his wife and accomplice, Marie-Anne Martinet, who [[possession of stolen goods|stole the personal belongings]] and used them for resale. Their trial took place from January 29 to February 1, 1862: Dumollard was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] and his wife, twenty years of [[penal labour]]. This affair, which preceded that of [[Joseph Vacher]] by about thirty years, had a great repercussion in France; it is often considered one of the first cases of a serial killer in France. Dumollard is notably mentioned in ''[[Les Misérables]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]].

== Biography ==
=== Youth ===
[[File:Los esposos Dumollard.jpg|thumb|right|Representation of the Dumollard couple in 1864.|alt=Représentation des époux Dumollard parue en 1864.]]
Martin Dumollard was the son of Marie-Josephte Rey and Pierre Dumollard. The latter, a native of [[Pest, Hungary]], arrived in France in [[Salins-les-Thermes]] where he met Marie-Josephte, who came from the region.{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=68-69}} The couple moved between [[Dagneux]] and Tramoyes, where Martin was born in 1810. He was baptized in [[Mionnay]] because Tramoyes was not a parish at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Library of the judicial monitor|1903|p=7|id=6k5823549c}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1813, the Dumollards had a second child named Raymond, who died at a young age.{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=68-69}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.leprogres.fr/loisirs/2013/10/19/martin-dumolard-un-orphelin-devenu-serial-killer-de-jeunes-filles|title=Martin Dumollard, an orphan turned into serial killer of young girls|publisher=leprogres.fr|date=19 October 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin was subsequently nicknamed "Raymond" by the villagers of Dagneux.{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=126}}

According to some authors, the surname "Dumollard" is a French version of the Hungarian name of Martin's father: "Demola".{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=68-69}} In this regard, some sources incorrectly connect the name "Dumollard" to the locality of Dagneux named "Le [[wikt:Molard|Molard]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgallica.bnf.fr%2Fark%3A%2F12148%2Fcb336097645|title=Memories of an executioner in Paris|publisher=Charaire and Sons|date=1877|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his trial, Martin Dumollard recalled the supposed fatal destiny of his father: he would have fled Hungary because of a criminal past there. When the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] forces armies arrived in Ain in 1814, Pierre Dumollard feared to be recognized and fled to [[Padua]]. However, troops were also present there, and after he was recognized by the Hungarian forces as a wanted criminal, he arrested and executed by [[dismemberment]]. Martin, aged four, and his mother attended the event.{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=68-69}}

Marie-Josephte died impoverished on April 15, 1842 in Dagneux, while her son fled to Lyon due to thefts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Library of the judicial monitor|1903|p=9|id=6k5823549c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Dumollard began working as a shepherd at the age of eight. He was a servant under Guichard, owner of Sure castle in [[Saint-André-de-Corcy]]&lt;ref name=judi8&gt;{{harvsp|Library of the Judicial Monitor|1903|p=8|id=6k5823549c}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, where he met Marie-Anne Martinet&lt;ref name=judi8/&gt;, with whom he married much later, on June 29, 1840. After their marriage, the young couple settled in the village of [[Le Montellier]] in Côtière,{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=70}} before resettling in Dagneux.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== Known crimes ==
His [[modus operandi]] was to approach young girls, especially from Lyon, and pretend to be a master employee looking for a new servant. Dumollard offered significant emoluments for this type of job and then trained the young girls, who usually learned quickly, in the rural region of Côtière de l'Ain. Some of these girls would later become his victims.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The investigation led by Justice Genod de [[Trévoux]] revealed only twelve assaults (including three murders), plans for assault and robbery. The attacks were extremely violent, as evidenced by that of Marie-Eulalie Bussod on February 26, 1861,{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=87-88}} who after being stripped of her clothes, was wounded in the head and raped before being buried alive.{{sfn|Chauvaud|2007|p=42}}.

The twelve victims were as following:{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=87-88}}
# Marie Baday (murdered), end of February 1855
# Olympe Alubert, March 4, 1855
# Josephte Charletty, September 22, 1855
# Jeanne-Marie Bourgeois, October 31, 1855
# Victorine Perrin, November 1855
# Unidentified woman in the woods of Montmain (murdered), November or December 1855
# Julie Fargeat, January 18, 1859
# Unidentified woman in the [[Sainte-Croix, Ain|Sainte-Croix]] mill, December 11, 1859
# The Laborde daughter in the inn, February 1860
# Louise Michel, April 30, 1860
# Marie-Eulalie Bussod (murdered), February 25 or 26, 1861
# Marie Pichon (attempted murder), May 26, 1861

The absence of proven murders between 1855 and 1859 was also examined. Dumollard was seen accompanied by a girl in [[Vénissieux]] in 1856 or 1857, before leaving. The body of the same girl was later found in this neighborhood, which became the [[lieu-dit]] of "The dead woman". Some of Dumollard's stories portray accomplices who would have killed her in [[Neyron]]. Finally, after 648 examined cases, Dumollard's guilt could only be established in the twelve attacks cited above.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=87-88}}

=== Marie Baday ===
[[File:Photographie de Marie Baday (victime de Dumollard) par Bernabé en 1855 sur le parvis de l'église de Tramoyes.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of Marie Baday's body by Bernabé in 1855, exposed on the forecourt of the church of Tramoyes|alt=Photographie du corps de Marie Baday par Bernabé en 1855, exposé sur le parvis de l'église de Tramoyes.]]
The first proven crime occurred in late February 1855. It was the murder of Marie Baday, whose body discovered by hunters in the forest of Montaverne in Tramoyes.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=9}} Her identification took several months. To make it easier, the examining magistrate Genod asked renowned photographer Lyonnais Camille Bernabé to come and take snapshots of the victim.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=10}} After first identifying her as Marceline Ganelli,{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=12}} the body was associated with the name of Marie Baday, thanks in particular to the checks carried out by her family. Her last owner,{{clarify|date=March 2019}} Madeleine Aussandon said that on the day of her disappearance, she left the room that they lived in together, after arguing for an offer for a new place paid over 200 [[franc]]s annually.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=16}} The first suspect was a man named Jacques Verger, who remained three months in prison after his arrest before being exonerated. A second suspect named Martin Mauriat was also considered, but he was in prison by the time of Baday's murder.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=17}}

=== Olympe Alubert ===
Judge Genod received a report of the case of a girl who appeared to have been assaulted in March 1855 before finding refuge at the Barbet family, at their farm in Mionnay.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=18-19}} Subsequently, the investigation collected the testimony of the assaulted girl, named Olympe Alubert. Genod thus obtained the modus operandi of the aggressor. Dumollard had approached her on February 25, 1855 at the La Guillotière in Lyon, offering her a good, very well-paid place "between [[Neuville-sur-Saône]] and [[Miribel, Ain|Miribel]]." The following Sunday, he picked her up, and when they arrived in the Mionnay area, he assaulted her, but Alubert managed to escape.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In her testimony, Olympe gave several elements relating to the yet unidentified Dumollard:

{{Cquote|quote="He just has a misshapen lip. [...] He inspired with confidence despite his swollen lip, with his good nature [...], speaking French very well. He seemed to be in his fifties.}}

=== Josephte Charletty ===
Josephte Charletty, a native of [[Saint-Félix, Haute-Savoie|Saint-Félix]] and a servant at [[Vernaison]], testified in September 1855 that a man, none other than Dumollard, had approached her in Lyon and offered her a place to stay in Côtière. She was appointed to meet her new boss on September 22. They left Lyon, walking on the plateau of [[La Croix-Rousse]] and continuing their way through the [[Fort de Montessuy]]. Dumollard's repeated questions about any possible savings she might have had on her made Charletty distrustful. On the way, she took the initiative to ask for lodging for the night on a farm, then agreed with Dumollard for an appointment the next day, one that she did not honor. She returned to Lyon, where she did file a complaint.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=20-21}}

=== Jeanne-Marie Bourgeois ===
[[File:Mionnay - Haras de Polletins.jpg|thumb|right|Domaine de Polletins (in 2013), where Jeanne-Marie Bourgeois found help on October 31, 1855 in the evening|alt=Photographie du domaine de Polletins en 2013.]]
Dumollard used the same tactic on October 30, 1855. He approached 22-year-old [[La Chapelle-Thècle]] native Jeanne-Marie Bourgeois in Lyon, and offered her a nice place in Trévoux. The young woman was convinced and they hit the road the following day. Increasingly suspicious and worried about the journey, she left Dumollard's company and ran towards the first farm she saw. She was found in Polletins filed{{clarify|date=March 2019}} close to the ancient monastery of Polletins in Mionnay. The farmer who collected it,{{clarify|date=March 2019}} Benoît Berthelier, immediately made the link with the murder of Marie Baday, discovered in the forest of Montaverne in February of that year. In March-April 1856, Ms. Bourgeois was questioned by Judge Genod in the context of the "Marie Baday case". At that time, Jacques Verger was incarcerated; Genod therefore organized a confrontation. The woman's testimony helped clear him as she did not recognized the man.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=22-23}}

=== Victorine Perrin ===
In November 1855, Dumollard managed to persuade 22-year-old Victorine Perrin, from [[Lons-le-Saunier]], to follow him to Côtière, again with the promise of a good place to stay. He also managed to persuade her to put her most precious things in a small trunk that he offered to carry. They left towards [[Montluel]] through La Croix-Rousse then to Rillieux. In the neighborhood of Neyron, Dumollard fled, stealing all of her belongings. Perrin was collected by Neyron residents shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=24-25}}

=== Unidentified woman in the Montmain Woods ===
The case of the woman in the Montmain Woods (near Dagneux) became known after the arrest of Dumollard and his wife. On July 28, 1861, Judge Genod interrogated Marie-Anne Martinet. During the interrogation, she told that her husband had killed a girl four years ago in the Montmain Woods. One evening, he returned with some of the victims' belongings, including gold earrings. He then returned to the victim to bury her, going to the Montluel station the next day with a trunk in which her body was stored. On July 31, Genod, Guillot (a clerk), Messrs. De Piellard (Imperial Attorney) and Raspail ([[Gendarme]] Commander of the Borough) accompanied the woman in handcuffs to the Montmain Woods, and after some searching, the girl's body was discovered. Dumollard denied guilt, despite his wife's claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Cuisinier|2008|p=55-57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Julie Fargeat ===
Dumollard approached Julie Fargeat on January 17, 1859 in Lyon. This girl, originating from [[Thizy, Rhône|Thizy]], had just lost her residence due to [[pregnancy]]. She was persuaded to accept employment in the area of Saint-André-de-Corcy that Dumollard offered, and travelled towards it the next day. As night fell, Dumollard attacked her, pulling off her apron containing her savings. She screamed so loudly that he fled; her cries attracted two villagers, Simon Mallet and his son Louis. On January 20, she filed a statement with the gendarmes of Saint-André-de-Corcy. Having no document to prove her identity (as it was stolen), her claim was met with skepticism and she was charged with vagrancy.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=26-27}}

=== Unidentified woman in Sainte-Croix ===
On December 11, 1859, a [[mill (grinding)|miller]] from Sainte-Croix named Jean-Pierre Chrétien indirectly witnessed an attack on a woman in Sainte-Croix. As the woman was never found or identified, the attacks was one of twelve cases selected at Dumollard's trial, in which Chrétien was one of seventy-one witnesses. The events were as followed: in the evening, shortly after seeing a young woman accompanied by a man carrying a package, she came running back. She explained that the man had fled with her savings and her parcel containing her personal belongings. Chrétien tried to catch the thief, but was unsuccessful. He let the girl stay at his home for the night before leaving for Lyon on the following morning. In the absence of other details, the young woman is called "The Unknown of Sainte-Croix" in court documents.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=28-29}}

=== The Laborde daughter of the inn ===
Very little is known about this woman. The case concerning the victim has, above all, provided a better understanding of Dumollard's modus operandi. If his method of approach was invariable, it appeared that he also had certain habits every time he came to Lyon: he regularly ate at Marguerite Chorel's restaurant at 7, and usually slept in the Lobarde Inn held by Louise-Adèle Fleury, wife of Louis Laborde. In the beginning of February 1860, Dumollard presented himself at the inn, accompanied by a young girl who, he said, was his niece, asking for a room with two beds. A few moments later, the girl fled, pursued by Dumollard. She came at the end of February 1860{{clarify|date=March 2019|reason=Beginning or end of February?}} to the Laborde Inn, as the survey revealed. It is not known who she was or if Dumollard managed to catch her. However, during the investigation, Ms. Laborde formally recognized the tote and dress of the girl among the objects taken from Dumollard's home, which suggests an additional murder.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=30-31}}

=== Louise Michel ===
Dumollard met Michel on April 29, 1860. He managed to convince her without difficulty to follow him and made an appointment for the next day on the Tilsit bridge. They took the path of Neuville-sur-Saône then [[Civrieux]] on horseback and on foot. In the neighborhood of Civrieux, Dumollard attacked Michel and threatened her to hand over her money. She managed to escape and was collected by a farmer named Claude Aymond.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=32-36}}

Dumollard renounced this act, and continued towards Saint-André-de-Corcy by cutting through farmland, where he met two peasants who asked what he was doing. It turned out it was Simon and Louis Mallet, from two years earlier, in January 1859, who saved Julie Fargeat. In May 1860, the Mallets, accompanied by Claude Aymond, testified before Judge Genod in Trévoux. This brought Michel in Trévoux and exonerated an incarcerated suspect named Audrillat, whom she did not recognize. It seemed that at this time, Judge Genod had little faith in the hypothesis of the culprit with "misshapen lip" for all the attacks on the maids.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=32-36}}

=== Marie-Eulalie Bussod ===

Only after Dumollard's arrest in May 1861 and the following interest around the case did three women report to the authorities the disappearance of their sister Marie-Eulalie in February 1861, when an individual had visited her and proposed that she work as a maid. Judge Genod listened to one of the sisters' testimonies, that of Marie-Josephte, on July 16, 1861, in Trévoux. She was presented with the many items of clothing seized from Dumollard and stored in Trévoux, recognizing some of them as belonging to her missing sister. Marie-Josephte having furtively met the visitor who proposed the post, Genod undertook to confront her with Dumollard; she immediately recognized him as the man whom her sister followed several months ago.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=60-63}}

Following Marie-Anne Martinet's revelations, Genod inspected the woods near [[Pizay]] on July 31. On August 1, Martinet and Dumollard were taken separately to the place where, against all expectations, Dumollard said:{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=58-59}}

{{Cquote|quote="I know where the body is and I am ready to take you there."}}

Dumollard kept his word and a buried body was quickly exhumed. Early findings contributed to the conclusion that the victim was buried alive after being raped. The three sisters were called in Pizay and identified the body as that of Bussod.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=58-59}} The emotions were so strong in Pizay that two crosses were quickly placed on the communal territory, the first being on the place of the body's discovery which since has been called the "Woods of the Dead".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} It bears the following inscription:

&lt;center&gt;''Here Marie-Eulalie Bussod was murdered''&lt;br /&gt;''February 25, 1861''&lt;br /&gt;{{lang|la|[[wikt:de profundis|De profundis]]|{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=58-59}}}}&lt;/center&gt;

The second is located at the Pizay cemetery and bears the following inscription:

&lt;center&gt;''Here lies one of the victims of an infamous murderer''&lt;br /&gt;''Marie-Eulalie Bussod''&lt;br /&gt;''Aged 42 years from [[Loisia]]''&lt;br /&gt;''Murdered on February 25''&lt;br /&gt;''And buried on August 2, 1861''&lt;br /&gt;''De profundis''&lt;/center&gt;

In November 2013, neither the cross of the cemetery nor the cross in the "Woods of the Dead" seem to be present at the places indicated. The book ''Tourist and archaeological Riches of Montluel Township'' from 1999 indicated the latter as always located in the woods, but in 2013, it was reported as missing on the website of the Pizay town.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Marie Pichon and Dumollard's arrest ===
[[File:Maison de Martin Dumollard à Dagneux, lors de son arrestation.jpg|thumb|right|Dumollard's house in Dagneux.|alt=Carte postale ancienne de la maison des Dumollard, à Dagneux.]]
On May 28, 1861, Dumollard approached Marie Pichon on the Guillotière bridge{{sfn|Le Breton|2013|pp=201}} in Lyon and offered her a job as a maid in Dagneux with an annual pay of 250 francs.{{sfn|Le Breton|2013|pp=202}} Pichon accepted, gathered her few belongings in a trunk and accompanied Dumollard to the train station in Montluel, where they arrived at late evening. Then followed a walk in the woods, to the heights of Dagneux.{{sfn|Le Breton|2013|pp=203}} There Dumollard assaulted and tried to strangle her with a lariat, but Pichon escaped,{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=37}}{{sfn|Le Breton|2013|pp=204}} and ran to find refuge in Joly farm in [[Balan, Ain|Balan]], with Mr. Joly then contacting the [[garde champêtre]] in Dagneux. Listening to the precise description of Marie Pichon, the authorities were reminded of the domiciled Dumollard in Dagneux.{{sfn|Le Breton|2013|pp=205}} After a quick visit to the home of "Raymond", as the Dagneux villagers called him, guards immediately warned Judge Genod, who ordered for the suspect to be arrested on June 2, 1861. The next day, a first confrontation took place between Pichon and Dumollard, whom she recognized immediately.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=43-44}}

The investigation established that one of the objectives of the murders was theft of fabrics and clothes. During the [[search and seizure|search]] at the home of the accused, the investigators found 1250 women's clothes (garters, stockings, petticoats, handkerchiefs, lace shawls, hats, dresses, etc.) belonging to the victims.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|p=12}} Dumollard and his wife were imprisoned in Trévoux while awaiting trial, which was to be held on January 29, 1862 in [[Bourg-en-Bresse]].{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=120}}

== Trial and execution ==
=== Trial ===
[[File:Lardière.jpg|thumb|right|Maître Lardière, one of Dumollard's two lawyers.|alt=Photographie de Maître Lardière, l'un des deux avocats de Dumollard.]]
Dumollard's trial ran from January 29 to February 1, 1862 in the Bourg-en-Bresse court, before which a crowd of 4,000 to 5,000 press people attended on the morning of January 29.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=122-123}} Two lawyers defended Dumollard: Marius Lardière and Mr. Villeneuve. Ladière was chosen by Dumollard because he was from Dagneux.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=125-126}}{{sfn|Tisseur|1885|p=138}} The courthouse welcomed journalists from a dozen periodicals, including ''Le salute republic'', ''Le Loire Memorial'', the ''Journal de Genève'' and ''[[Le Progrès]]''. Darmet Guerin, a bookseller, was responsible for the trial's transcript.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=122-123}} The prosecution was represented by Louis Gaulot (Attorney General), Prandière (prosecutor) and Joachim Jeandet (imperial prosecutor).{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=124}} The [[cour d'assises]] was presided over by Marilhat, assisted by the Vice-President of Varennes and thirty-six jurors, all from the communities surrounding Ain.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=125-126}}

In addition to the reciting of the charges as well as the list of 71 witnesses scheduled, the first day was devoted to successive interrogations of Dumollard and his wife.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=130-138}} January 30 and 31 were mainly devoted to the presentation of the many exhibits (the hundreds of personal items seized by Dumollard) and the hearing of witnesses.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=139-167}} The hearing of February 1 was devoted to the end of the evidentiary hearings, the indictment and pleadings until about four in the afternoon.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=188}} The jury left the room to examine the various questions and returned at about 18:15. President Marilhat began to question their spokesman, Jean-Jacques Celsi on different verdicts made by the jury to successive questions.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=189-198}} The court retired to deliberate and returned about thirty minutes later. President Marilhat announced the various sentences:{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=199-201}} Dumollard was sentenced to death and his wife was sentenced to twenty years of penal labor. She died in the [[Auberive]] prison, in [[Haute-Marne]], where she was incarcerated, in 1875.

=== Execution ===
[[File:Place Carnot de Montluel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Place Bourgeat (renamed since "Place Carnot"), where Dumollard was guillotined.|alt=Photographie de la place Carnot où fut guillotiné Dumollard.]]
[[File:Pierre-Henri Gérault de Langalerie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lithograph of Mr. Langalerie who met Dumollard in his cell in February 1862.|alt=Torse et visage d'un homme d'église.]]
After his death sentence on February 1, 1862, Dumollard was again imprisoned in Bourg-en-Bresse. He received a number of visits from Lardière first, then Father Béroud and a prison [[vicar]]. He was also visited by Mr. Langalerie, bishop of Belley, who sought repentance unsuccessfully on his part. He nevertheless gave him his blessings and offered a portrait of [[St. John Vianney]].{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=202-203}}

On February 27, 1862, Dumollard learned that his cassation appeal was rejected, and the two lawyers assigned for the occasion, Achille Morin and Gigot, having not even filed a brief. He was also informed of the execution method chosen, the guillotine, an announcement to which he reacted by saying: "I like it better than to be like my father, quartered on a wheel being pulled in all directions by horses."{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=202-203}}

On March 7, 1862, the guillotine stored in Bourg-en-Bresse was carried away in Montluel. That same day, Father Béroud demanded that Dumollard share a last meal with his wife. Soon after, he was taken to Montluel on horseback, accompanied by Father Béroud.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=204-205}} The car arrived on March 8 at four in the morning in Montluel, awaited by a large crowd despite the morning schedule. As the Montluel Prison was in very poor condition, Dumollard was led to the Council Chamber where magistrate Simonnet awaited. He agreed to a final interview in private between Dumollard, Father Béroud and the priest of [[Montluel|Montluel, Carrel]].{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=206-207}} Dumollard then drank a cup of coffee, then a last glass of [[Madeira wine]].{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=210-211}}

At 6:45, Dumollard was asked to use the horseback to go to the scaffold 150 meters away, which he refused. Accompanied by Father Béroud, the parish priest Carrel and the executioners, and in front of a crowd of 5,000, Dumollard walked on foot to Bourgeat Square (now Place Carnot) where a scaffold was installed, on which he kneeled and kissed the [[crucifix]] presented.{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=210-211}} He was executed around 7 o'clock in the morning.

==Other serial killers of the 1800s==
Serial killers seemed to appear in France during the second half of the 19th century.{{cn|date=March 2019}} Dumollard was often compared to Joseph Philippe (murderer of prostitutes in France around 1866),&lt;ref name="crimjustice"&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Reconstitution DMP de la face de Dumollard.JPG|thumb|left|Result of the DMP method applied to Dumollard and kept at the Testut-Latarjet Museum.|alt=Représentation du visage de Dumollard.]]
Following his execution, Dumollard's body was buried in an indeterminate place, even if a strong presumption indicates that his resting place might be at the edge of the adjoining St. Bartholomew's Chapel of Montluel. The man's head was sent (in a special box) to the [[Claude Bernard University Lyon 1|Lyon Medical School]] at the beginning of March 1862.{{sfn|George|2011|pp=143}}{{sfn|Cuisinier|2008|pp=214}} Upon receipt, studies were launched to analyze Dumollard's skull: thus several cast plasters are kept in the Testus-Latarjet Museum.{{sfn|George|2011|pp=143}}

The skull was gradually abandoned and forgotten before being analyzed again in the 1960s. These works on the skull at the Hôpital d'instruction des armées Desgenettes concluded that Dumollard had an [[angioma]] on his lip.{{sfn|George|2011|pp=143}}

In the mid-1980s, three researchers from Lyon, Claire Desbois, Claude Mallet and Raoul Perrot, developed a method of reconstructing the face from data derived from the single bone structure.{{sfn|George|2011|pp=144}} They call it "DMP",&lt;ref name="dmpmethod92"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Desbois |first1=Claire |last2=Mallet |first2=Claude |last3=Perrot |first3=Raoul |title=La méthode DMP de reconstitution faciale dans l'identification médico-légale |journal=PaléoBios |date=1992 |volume=8 |pages=1-21 |url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fanthropologie-et-paleopathologie.univ-lyon1.fr%2FHTML%2FHTML%2FPALEOBIOS%25201992%2520VOL%25208%2520%2520LA%2520METHODE%2520DMP%2520DE%2520RECONSTITUTION%2520FACIALE.pdf |accessdate=8 October 2018 |trans-title=The DMP method of facial reconstruction in forensic identification |location=Lyon, France |language=French |issn=0294-121X}}&lt;/ref&gt; of their initials, using this method to make a [[three-dimensional space|three dimensional]] representation of Dumollard's face. Comparison with photographs from the time period were used to validate the new method.{{sfn|George|2011|pp=144}} The result of this experimentation, the bust made from Dumollard's head after execution and the reconstituated face from the real skin of Dumollard are all preserved at the Testut-Latarjet Museum.{{sfn|George|2011|pp=143}}

Victor Hugo makes an explicit reference to Martin Dumollard in Volume I of his novel ''Les Misérables'':&lt;ref name="Hugo2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor Hugo|title=Les Misérables|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R57VeupVJkwC&amp;pg=PT1477|date=7 November 2013|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-139262-2|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work ''Bouvard, Flaubert and Pécuchet'', dealing with ''[[Bouvard et Pécuchet]]'', [[Roger Kempf]] explains that [[Gustave Flaubert]], very much influenced by the Dumollard affari, first named one of the characters "Dumolard", who later became "Dubolard", and finally "Bouvard."&lt;ref name="Flaubert1896"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gustave Flaubert|title=Bouvard and Pécuchet|url=https://archive.org/details/bouvardandpcuch00hanngoog|year=1896|publisher=H.S.

On television, in 1967, an episode of the television series ''En votre âme et conscience'' called ''The Dumollard Affair'' was devoted to the serial killer. It was directed by Jean Bertho and the actor [[Étienne Bierry]] played the role of Dumollard.

==Biography==
Dominique was investigated in late 2006 following a police report by a man who refused to let Dominique tie him up. The final victim, Chris Sutterfield, had died about two months earlier.

Following his arrest on December 1, 2006, Dominique confessed to the rape and murder of at least 23 men over a ten-year period beginning in 1997. He committed the crimes in [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebonne]], [[Lafourche Parish|Lafourche]], [[Iberville Parish, Louisiana|Iberville]], [[St. Charles Parish, Louisiana|St. Charles]] and [[Jefferson Parish|Jefferson ]] parishes in suburban [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=HoumaCourierCourtTV20061207/&gt;&lt;ref name=HoumaCourierCourtTV20061218/&gt; In his confession, Dominique, who is gay, said he frequented area [[gay bar]]s and targeted men he thought would be willing to have sex for money. He also lured straight men by setting up fake drug deals or showing men a picture of women and telling them that she was willing to pay for sex with a Black man.{{cn|date=January 2020}} He murdered them to avoid being convicted and sentenced to prison for rape. He was charged with multiple cases of rape and [[first-degree murder]].&lt;ref name=HoumaCourierCourtTV20061207/&gt;&lt;ref name=HoumaCourierCourtTV20061218/&gt;

On September 23, 2008, Dominique was sentenced to eight life sentences after confessing to raping and killing his male victims over a 10-year period.&lt;ref name="Fox News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/09/24/louisiana-serial-killer-gets-8-life-terms-for-8-murders.html|title=Louisiana Serial Killer Gets 8 Life Terms for 8 Murders|date=September 24, 2008|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominique pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in a deal to avoid the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Fox News"/&gt; He is incarcerated at the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] in Angola.&lt;ref name="Sword and Scale"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Chris Blondell |title=The Gentle, Pathetic Serial Killer |url=http://swordandscale.com/the-gentle-pathetic-serial-killer/ |website=Sword and Scale |accessdate=30 September 2018 |date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crime Feed"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Mike McPadden |title=Ronald Dominique: “The Bayou Serial Killer” Who Decimated Gay Louisiana - CrimeFeed |url=http://crimefeed.com/2017/09/32493/ |website=CrimeFeed |publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC. |accessdate=30 September 2018 |date=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ryuun Daimai''' (born 1872 as '''Ryumoto Daimai''' - June 26, 1916) was a [[Japan|Japanese]] [[serial killer]] and rapist, active during the [[Taishō]] era. Since many of his victims were [[bhikkhunī]], the media nicknamed him '''The Nun Slayer'''.&lt;ref name="madison"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~madison/murder/text_japan/ryuun.html|title=Daimai Ryuun|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
According to the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department]], Ryumoto Daimai was born in [[Asakusa]] in 1872, the son of a pawnbroker. When he was 7 years old, he was sent to a temple in [[Ōita Prefecture]] to be taken care of by the [[Abbot (Buddhism)|abbot]]. He trained under his former name, later receiving the name "Ryuun". In 1890, the priest passed away, and Daimai left the temple to train [[judo]] at a dojo in [[Kumamoto Prefecture]], as a [[uchi-deshi]]. During the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], which broke out in 1894, he volunteered for the military, but got his nose disfigured due to sustained injuries from a land mine.&lt;ref&gt;Goda Criminal History Society (2000) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; He later set up a temple in [[Shimada, Shizuoka|Shimada]], [[Shizuoka Prefecture]], but eventually went out and began wandering around the country.&lt;ref name="madison"/&gt;

Not long after, numerous robberies and thefts were reported, with victims describing the assailant as a monk in torn robes. Eventually, Daimai was jailed for four years in the Anon Tsu Prison, in [[Mie Prefecture]]. On January 4, 1913, he was released.&lt;ref name="madison"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~madison/murder/text_japan/ryuun.html|title=大米龍雲|access-date=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yabusaka"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yabusaka.moo.jp/ama.htm|title=連続尼僧殺し事件|access-date=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crimes ==
Daimai's crimes following his imprisonment became increasingly cruel and brutal, invading nunneries to rape and rob the nuns, and in some cases kill them, setting the structures ablaze to hide his crimes. The judiciary recorded three robbery-murders, five rapes, seven robberies and nine thefts, but the actual number of rapes and murders remains unknown. Most of the rape victims were nuns, some of them average worshippers or [[miko]], and others were affected regardless of age. It was reported that some of the victims, whom screamed too loudly, had their tongues pulled out by hand and subsequently killed.

The main offenses were as follows:

* In 1905, in [[Amagasaki]], [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], he killed a 72-year-old nun, stealing 24 [[Japanese yen|yen]].&lt;ref name="madison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yabusaka"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yabusaka.moo.jp/ama.htm|title=連続尼僧殺し事件|access-date=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 1913, Daimai raped a 60-year-old nun in [[Odawara]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], stealing a savings bankbook and 200 yen. All of the yen was later spent at a [[Red-light district|red light district]] in Fukuhara, [[Kobe]].
* In the summer of 1913, he quarreled with a 26-year-old man in Kobe, killing him near a wharf.
* Later that year, he broke into a house in [[Fukuoka]] and raped a female restaurant manager. He later made that woman his concubine.
* In the summer of 1914, he moved to Tokyo, residing in a rented room in Kyobashi. There, he robbed the Namba Temple and adjacent places.
* On September 5, 1914, in [[Kyoto]], he pulled out the tongue of a 58-year-old nun before killing her.
* On October 29, 1914, a 72-year-old nun was killed in Totsuka, Tokyo.
* On November 11, 1914, he sneaked into Nunnera Temple in [[Kamakura]], beat up the monk and fled with 20 yen and some clothing.　
* On January 27, 1915, he killed a 21-year-old nun in Kamakura.
* On July 18, 1915, a 69-year-old nun was raped and robbed in [[Asagaya]]. Testimonies from other nuns described the suspect's age, height and peculiar disfigured nose.

It is said that Daimai managed to avoid arrest, despite committing crimes from Tokyo to Keihanshin, because he used different aliases. Police suspected that a different person had raped more than 40 nuns, and mistakenly arrested him instead.&lt;ref&gt;Hidaka (2008) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrest, trial and execution ==
Daimai was arrested on August 8, 1915, at [[Hakata Station]] in Fukuoka.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=A violent struggle during escort of violent murderer|last=|first=|date=August 14, 1915|work=Asahi Shimbun (Tokyo morning edition)|access-date=|url-status=live|page=5}} - Viewed on Mizou II Visual&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, a police officer received information that the suspect intended to fly to [[Kyushu]] under the assumed name of "Utchitsuma", and despite the severe resistance, managed to arrest him.&lt;ref&gt;Goda Criminal History Research Society (2000) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 22, 1916, the [[Tokyo District Court]] sentenced Ryuun Daimai to death, with telling the judge that "[he]'ll do it for you, because it's troublesome".&lt;ref name="gouda2000"&gt;Goda Criminal History Research Society (2000) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 1916, he was executed in the Tokyo Prison (currently located in [[Shinjuku]]).&lt;ref name="madison"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“The execution of Ryuun is depressing and fast”. The Asahi Shimbun (Tokyo morning edition): p. 5 (June 27, 1916) - Viewed in the Enzo II visual&lt;/ref&gt; According to contemporary accounts from the guards, he ate buns and drank tea, chewed [[nicotiana tabacum]] and was allowed to smoke. It was said that he had a dignified attitude, saying: "Because I couldn't smoke for a long time, I went crazy." While waiting for final moments on death row, guards attempted to make a blindfold that was "antidiarrheal Yai". His last purported words were supposedly "If I could be sentenced to death, I would like to die cleanly like this. Let's get it done".&lt;ref&gt;Goda Criminal History Research Society (2000) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sergei Ivanovich Dovzhenko''' (born June 30, 1972) is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[serial killer]], a former operative of the Mariupol police. He confessed to committing 19 murders between November 1998 and May 2002 in his native city. Among his victims are a 12-year-old girl, four employees of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine]] and one [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] citizen.&lt;ref name="ilich"&gt;[http://ilich.in.ua/news.php?id=84 ''Сумцов Д.''

== Biography ==

=== Before the murders ===
He was born in 1972 in Mariupol. Dovzhenko studied at the Mariupol Commercial College as a commodity researcher. He then served in the army, where he gained the name "Murchik". He was also engaged in boxing, being a former two-time vice-champion boxer in Ukraine, as well as being a private entrepreneur in the market, before working for a Mariupol firm named Citadel. After his discharge, he did not work for a long time in the militia (taking into account the police school and the internship of 10 months).

=== Prehistory ===
On the night of June 18, 1997, when Dovzhenko was already serving in the militia, the office of his former employers, the Citadel, was attacked. A security guard, Sergei Mitchenko, was killed and 5 thousand [[hryvnias]] disappeared from the safe. At the crime scene, cartridges were found from a PM pistol. Suspicion fell on Dovzhenko. On June 27, 1997, he was arrested in the workplace. Examination of the service weapon he Dovzhenko used proved that the victim was killed with it. Sergei accepted help from his brother Valery, the director of a law firm in Mariupol, and proved his innocence.&lt;ref name="gazeta"&gt;[http://www.gazeta.ru/2003/01/09/sudatmariupo.shtml ''Ирина Петракова.'' Мариупольский милиционер убивал от обиды] // «Газета.Ру», 10 января 2003 года&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the results of a repeated examination in Kiev, Dovzhenko was able to prove that the first one was fabricated.&lt;ref name="ostro"&gt;[http://www.ostro.org/general/society/articles/48/ ''Анастасия Светлицкая.'' Злорадство убийцы, или Зачем бывший «мент» перекрасился в «маньяка»?] // ИА «Остров», 4 декабря 2002 года&lt;/ref&gt; During the investigation, Dovzhenko was in custody for eight months, when on March 30, 1998, he was released, but was also fired from the internal affairs authorities for forgery of documents (falsified entry in the workbook). According to his lawyer, Dovzhenko repeatedly tried to get a job, including in law enforcement, but officials continually denied him, allegedly provoking the conversion of Dovzhenko into a serial killer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cripo.com.ua/print.php?sect_id=5&amp;aid=1094 ''Юрий Стрелков.'' Скоро Украина получит второго серийного убийцу?] // «Украина Криминальная», 10 декабря 2002 года&lt;/ref&gt; The former policeman decided to take revenge on his offenders.

=== Murders ===
According to Dovzhenko, his first victim was the former owner of the Citadel, Vladimir Chekmak, who was the first to suspect that an employee had caused the attack in the firm's office. According to Dovzhenko, he watched Chekmak for about a month. On November 19, 1998, Dovzhenko allegedly made his way to the victim's house and put on his police uniform he brought with him in a nearby entrance. When Chekmak arrived by car and opened the front door, Dovzhenko shot him from the edge of 12-caliber gun. Since Chekmak was still alive, Dovzhenko cut his throat with a knife, then turned towards Chekmak's friend, Igor Karimov, whom he allegedly mistook for the head of the personnel department of the Citadel, and also killed him. In addition, the driver Andrei Lyubichov and the commercial director of the Citadel Sergei Shaturov, who were also in the car, were injured. That same night police officers came to Dovzhenko, but they found nothing during the search, and Dovzhenko's wife also confirmed his alibi.

After this, Dovzhenko decided to take revenge on his former co-workers. By committing murder, he hoped to worsen the disclosure rates and thereby achieve the dismissal of responsible police chiefs.

The killer's next victim was Valentina Gladilina, who sold perfumes at a street market. On April 17, 1999, after changing into a police uniform, Dovzhenko met Gladilina at the entrance of her house and presented a fake ID of a police officer. She felt that Dovzhenko wanted to talk to her about a theft in her house and invited him in. Dovzhenko killed her and robbed a thousand dollars from the house. For this murder, Dovzhenko used a pistol, bought from his friend Vitaly Shemyakov. Its feature was the presence of five rifling instead of the standard four.

The same weapon was used in the murder of a militia captain named Alexander Kokin and his wife Ekaterina on June 27, 1999. The mother-in-law of the captain, Galina Krokhaleva, was also wounded. According to her testimony, Dovzhenko was with an accomplice.

Subsequently, Dovzhenko simplified the scheme for selecting victims—he bought newspapers with ads and was looking for offers where it was reported about the sale of expensive things. Having determined where the seller lives and to whom of his former colleagues, accordingly, the investigation of the crime scene will take place, he was preparing for the murder, and he took money and property to "feed".

On September 10, 1999, Dovzhenko killed Lyudmila Shevchenko and her son Sergei. She had given an advertisement in the newspaper about the sale of a video camera.

On December 13, 1999, Ivan Vakulenko and his son Vitaly, who were trying to sell a computer, were killed.

On July 7, 2000, Dovzhenko killed his friend Vitaly Shemyakov. Shemyakov, following the chronicles of events in the press, drew attention to the "atypicality" of the murder weapon (a pistol with five cuts). He knew that this is exactly what he sold to Dovzhenko in 1999. Shemyakov began blackmailing Dovzhenko, demanding large sums of money in exchange for his silence. Dovzhenko then came to his friend's house and slit his throat.

On December 15, 2000, the murdered shot down a police patrol. Police officers Alexander Rogovets, Vladimir Fedorenko and Andrei Karpenko tried to detain Dovzhenko while he was hiding a gun in his shirtfront. Approaching them, he opened fire simultaneously from the cut-off and the pistol, then finished off the wounded on the ground, taking one of them out with a pistol.

At this time, for the murder of Vitaly Shemyakov, a man named Yegorov was convicted. Shemyakov's mother, Claudia Bondarenko, did not believe the physically weak Yegorov could deal with her son. In addition, she supported the version of the press that the killer was a former soldier or policeman. Sooner or later, she could have suspected a friend of her son—Sergei Dovzhenko. The murderer decided to get rid of Bondarenko. On June 27, 2001, Dovzhenko killed Claudia Bondarenko at her home. To ward off suspicion, he staged an assault with a robbery of Bondarenko's neighbours, during which he killed Galina Ivanova and her 12-year-old granddaughter Tanya. Dovzhenko took 3 thousand dollars from their apartment.

On May 17, 2002, Dovzhenko killed Artur Frolkov and Atso Simovich, who announced that they were selling a laptop.

== Victims ==
According to the criminal, the choice of victims was accidental and conditioned by the territory.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; — Sergei Dovzhenko's guilt has not been proven for these murders.

== Arrest and trial ==
Dovzhenko was arrested on May 17, 2002, after the murder of Frolkov and Simovich. On January 19, 2003, a trial began at the Maritime District Court. During the investigation, Dovzhenko confessed to 19 murders.

On September 8, 2003, the Court of Appeal of the Donetsk region decided to recognize the defendant as guilty of committing 17 murders. Two of the murders - that of Chekmak and Karimov - were considered justified. Witnesses Lyubichev and Shaturov's testimonies were denied by the court. Sergei Dovzhenko was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].

In November 2003, Dovzhenko refuted his testimony and submitted a request to the [[Supreme Court of Ukraine]] to review the case. In May 2006, the Supreme Court, having reviewed Dovzhenko's complaint, upheld the verdict without charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pr.ua/news.php?new=2333 ''Виктор Сухоруков.'' Пожизненный приговор серийному убийце Довженко наконец-то вступил в законную силу] // «Приазовский рабочий»&lt;/ref&gt;

The murders of Sergei Mitchenko, Vladimir Chekmak and Igor Karimov are still unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pr.ua/news.php?new=6286&amp;num=2 ''Виктор Сухоруков.'' Десять лет со дня гибели Игоря Каримова: его убийца по-прежнему остается на свободе] // «Приазовский рабочий»&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modus Operandi ==
Speaking at trial, Dovzhenko revealed the motives of his crimes: "Almost all murders were committed with one goal - to punish those who mock me. I wanted to punish the elders".  According to his version, Dovzhenko took revenge on police officers for being beaten after being detained on suspicion of killing Sergei Mitchenko. In an interview with newspaper "2000" he stated that they "stole his future", explaining that after his dismissal he could not find a decent job. As it turned out during the investigation, Dovzhenko experienced a perverse pleasure from the murders, and was recognized as sane.

According to the investigation, Sergei Dovzhenko acted with mercenary motives, his victims being random residents of Mariupol, who gave ads on in the newspaper about the sales of valuables.

According to the conclusion of the forensic psychological investigation, Dovzhenko was "secretive, ambitious, vindictive, possesses the features of a leader, the motive of his crimes — greed and revenge, transformed by internal unconscious marginal and necrophilic tendencies of personality".

== Unjustly convicted ==
For the murder of Shemyakov another man was sentenced—the repeatedly ill Yegorov. Being sick with [[tuberculosis]], Yegorov died in prison and acquitted after death.&lt;ref name="fakty"&gt;[http://fakty.ua/74499-quot-prisyad-i-ne-krichi-quot----velel-serijnyj-ubijca-13-letnej-devochke-a-zatem-vystrelil-ej-v-zatylok ''Елена Смирнова.'' «Присядь и не кричи», — велел серийный убийца 13-летней девочке, а затем выстрелил ей в затылок] // «Факты и комментарии», 12 сентября 2003 года&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
Married, no children.

His brother Valery, the director of a law firm, wanted to act as a defender of Sergei Dovzhenko during the trial, but was summoned by the court as a witness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ukr-info.net/smi/view_article.cgi?sid=16&amp;nid=187&amp;aid=1953 ''Олег Берег.''

'''Seyit Ahmet Demirci''' is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[serial killer]], who is dubbed "Mobilyacı katili" ("the Furniture dealers' Killer") in the media. He was convicted of killing three different furniture dealers.

Seyit Ahmet Demirci grew up in [[Fatsa]], [[Samsun Province]], northern Turkey.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;

As a child he worked in a furniture shop. He claimed that at his age of 11 the elderly shop owner had sexually abused him in the basement of the shop.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnt1"/&gt; He also claimed to have witnessed the molestation of a co-worker by the same employer in the shop basement.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

He moved to [[Istanbul]] and developed hatred towards furniture dealers, particularly to those who said they have some other furniture in the basement. He committed his first murder shooting Ali Osman Beldek in the neck at the Turgut Reis neighborhood of [[Esenler|Esenler, Istanbul]] on 5 May 1998. Then, he shot Mehmet Kayatuzu dead in [[Bağcılar|Bağcılar, Istanbul]] on 4 June 1998, and two days later killed Celal Pınargöz also in Esenler.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt; All three victims were selected randomly and unknown to him.  His modus operandi was to shoot them with a single bullet in the neck in their shop's basement.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt; He was dubbed by the media as "Mobilyacı katili" ("the Furniture dealers' Killer").&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnt1"/&gt;

He was arrested and prosecuted for serial murder. The judge focused on the possibility that mental illness was the  cause of his criminality, despite the fact that three forensic medicine institutions attested that he has sound mind. The court wanted to sentence him with leniency,&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt; however, he was sentenced to the death penalty in three counts.&lt;ref name="cnnt1"/&gt;

Demirci stated that, had he not been caught, he would have continued until he had killed eleven victims. The significance of the number eleven for him was that was his age at the time of the alleged molestation.&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;

'''Sibusiso Derrick Duma''' (born 6 May 1984) is a [[South Africa]]n [[serial killer]] who was convicted of two murders in 2007 and five murders in 2009 and sentenced to 8 [[Life Sentence|life sentence]]s in prison.&lt;ref name="Sentence"&gt;[http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Life-in-jail-for-serial-killer-20090817. ‘‘News 24’’ : Life in jail for Serial Killer.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was mostly active around the town of [[Pietermaritzburg]], [[KwaZulu Natal]].

Duma is a violent [[psychopathy|psychopath]] who partook of [[theft]], [[kidnapping]], [[torture]], [[rape]] and [[murder]]. He worked as a [[Share taxi|taxi driver]] and used his vehicle as a weapon on occasion as well as to obtain his victims. Duma’s reasoning, victimology and methodology changed sometimes from victim to victim, indicating that he was a [[disorganized offender|disorganized killer]].

Duma first killed on September 9, 2007 when he used his minibus taxi to run over and kill a Department of Education security guard, Mqeku Zondi. Duma had been hired to drive Mr. Zondi to his residence for an agreed upon fee. The conductor of Duma’s taxi, Mlungisi Bhengu, testified that Zondi reneged on paying the fare for some of the journey, at which point "Duma drove into the old man, ran over him with the wheels of the taxi and then reversed over his body again".&lt;ref name="Journalist"&gt;[http://www.thestar.co.za/?fSectionId=&amp;fArticleId=vn20090804122349860C600248. ‘‘The Saturday Star’’ : Jailed Killer denies killer rampage.]&lt;/ref&gt; Duma then robbed the victim of his remaining money and a 9mm [[Norinco]] pistol.

On the evening of October 14, 2007, Duma and his accomplice, Simphiwe Khesi, had been drinking at a local [[shebeen]]. Leaving a little after 19:00, the men realised that there would be no taxis available, so they planned to [[carjacking|hijack]] a vehicle in order to get home.&lt;ref name="Drinking"&gt;[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=15&amp;art_id=vn20071115033645135C710001#more. ‘‘iol’’ : Killers laugh at jail term.]&lt;/ref&gt; Finding a suitable vehicle, Duma shot and killed the driver, First National Bank employee Patricia Kippen (39). The shooting brought attention from nearby residents, causing the duo to abandon the vehicle. They soon found another possible target vehicle, shooting and killing the driver, former [[The Witness (South African newspaper)|Witness]] crime journalist, Elaine Anderson (59).&lt;ref name="Journalist"/&gt;

On October 19, 2007, Duma raped, shot and murdered Hlengiwe Shangase. Duma had waited near her home before dragging her to a desolate area and raping her. He then shot her in the head at point blank range using the [[Norinco]] pistol he had stolen from Mqeku Zondi.&lt;ref name="Journalist"/&gt;

The following day, Duma [[carjacking|hijacked]], shot and killed two men; Masizane Mtshatsha and Thamsanqua Mbindwane. An hour later, now driving in the [[carjacking|hijacked]] VW Polo, Duma kidnapped three further victims; Tsepo Mhlongo, Linda Jali and a teenage girl. The two men were robbed, ordered out of the vehicle, shot and left for dead. Duma with his accomplice, Simphiwe Khesi, took the young girl to Azalea Cemetery where they [[gang rape|rape]]d her. Duma then drove the stolen car over the girl multiple times in order to kill her.&lt;ref name="Journalist"/&gt;

Finally, on October 25, 2007, Duma kidnapped, robbed, raped and murdered Pinetown teacher, Noxolo Dlamini.

Duma was originally charged, convicted and sentenced along with Simphiwe Khesi for the murders of Kippen and Anderson on November 14, 2007. Judge President Vuka Tshabalala sentenced the men to 15 years each for attempting to rob Anderson and sentenced Duma to 15 years for robbing Kippen and Khesi 20 years, in addition to the life sentences for murder. Both men laughed when sentenced saying, "They're dead now. What are they worrying about?"&lt;ref name="Drinking"/&gt;

On August 4, 2009, Duma was further charged in connection with his various other crimes. On August 17, 2009, Acting Judge Kobus Booyens imposed a further six life sentences and prison terms totaling 104 years. He said he intends that Duma should be permanently removed from society.&lt;ref name="Sentence2"&gt;[http://serialkillerstalk.web-log.nl/. ‘‘Serial Killers Talk’’ : He must never leave jail.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and crimes==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2017}}
Dillon was born in [[Canton, Ohio]] and was a resident of nearby [[Magnolia, Ohio|Magnolia]]. He had a wife and son and was employed for twelve years as a [[draftsman]] at the [[Canton, Ohio|Canton Ohio]] Waterworks.

Between the period of April 1, 1989 to April 5, 1992, Dillon shot and killed five people in Ohio. His fourth victim, Claude Hawkins, was shot on [[Federal lands|federal property]] and was the reason the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] stepped in to join the investigation along with officers from the other three counties and the [[Ohio Department of Natural Resources]]. It was after this that the death of Kevin Loring was changed from an accident to a homicide.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Ten days after the [[task force]] meeting, Dillon would shoot his fifth victim, Gary Bradley, in [[Noble County, Ohio]]. Dillon was placed under surveillance in 1992 when a friend reported him after hearing the task force's initial press release concerning the murders. Larry Oller of [[Barnhill, Ohio]] was later shot at by Dillon while out hunting in [[Tuscarawas County, Ohio|Tuscarawas County]], but he escaped uninjured.

== Arrest ==
Dillon was arrested on a weapons charge on November 27, 1992, and he was placed under probation for owning a [[suppressor]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

After the death penalty was removed as an option for punishment, Dillon admitted to the killings. On July 12, 1993 at the [[Noble County Courthouse (Ohio)|Noble County Courthouse]], Dillon pleaded guilty to the five murders. Dillon was incarcerated at the [[Southern Ohio Correctional Facility]] for five [[consecutive sentence]]s of thirty years to life for [[aggravated murder]].&lt;ref name="offender"/&gt;

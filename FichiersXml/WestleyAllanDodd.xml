'''Westley Allan Dodd''' (July 3, 1961 &amp;ndash; January 5, 1993), was an American convicted [[serial killer]] and [[sex offender]]. In 1989, he [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] and murdered three young boys in [[Vancouver, Washington]]. He was arrested later that year after a failed attempt to abduct a six-year-old boy at a movie theater. 

Dodd wrote detailed accounts of his murders in a diary which was found by police. After pleading guilty to the charges of murder, he received the death penalty. After refusing an automatic appeal, his [[Capital punishment|execution]] by [[hanging]] on January 5, 1993 was the first legal hanging in the United States since 1965.

== Early life ==
Westley Allan Dodd was born in [[Richland, Washington]], on July 3, 1961, the oldest of Jim and Carol Dodd's three children.&lt;ref name="nytimes5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/29/us/illusions-are-also-left-dead-as-child-killer-awaits-noose.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=Illusions Are Also Left Dead As Child-Killer Awaits Noose|last=Egan|first=Timothy|date=December 29, 1992|publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114094923/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/29/us/illusions-are-also-left-dead-as-child-killer-awaits-noose.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|archivedate=November 14, 2013|url-status=live|accessdate=April 7, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd claimed he was never abused or neglected as a child.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Richard (producer and director).

''[[The Seattle Times]]'' reported that Westley Dodd described in a diary written during his imprisonment that his father was emotionally and physically abusive, that he was often neglected in favor of his younger siblings, and that he witnessed violent fights between his parents. At school, Dodd was not welcome into any social groups, leaving him with no friends. By the age of 9, Dodd had discovered that he was sexually attracted to other boys.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of a Man: Using Your Influence as a Man of Character|last=Johnson|first=Rick|publisher=Revell|location=Ada, Michigan|date=2009|isbn=978-1441203670|pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 3, 1976&amp;mdash;Dodd's 15th birthday&amp;mdash;his father attempted suicide following an argument with his wife.&lt;ref name="seattletimes3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930103&amp;slug=1677933|title=Westley Dodd: A Long, Steady Slide Into Dark Desperation|last1=Ostrom|first1=Carol M.|last2=Broom|first2=Jack|date=January 3, 1993|publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]]|location=Seattle, Washington|accessdate=July 15, 2018|newspaper=[[Seattle Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criminal history ==
{{more citations needed section|date=March 2014}}

===Sex offenses===
At the age of 13, Dodd began exposing himself to children in his neighborhood. His father eventually told an Oregon newspaper that he was aware of the boy's behavior but largely ignored it, since he felt his son was otherwise "a well-behaved child who never had problems with drugs, drinking, or smoking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Serial Murder and Media Circuses|last=Gibson|first=Dirk Cameron|date=2006|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=978-0275990640|location=Westport, Connecticut|page=160|chapter=Westley Allan Dodd}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he entered high school, Dodd had progressed to molestation, beginning with his younger cousins, and then neighborhood children he offered to babysit, as well as the children of a woman his father was dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Serial Murderers and their Victims|last=Hickey|first=Earl W.|date=2013|publisher=[[Cengage]]|isbn=978-0495600817|location=Boston, Massachusetts|page=184|chapter=Westley Allan Dodd, Sadistic Child Killer, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 15, Dodd was arrested for indecent exposure, but police released him with a recommendation of juvenile counseling.&lt;ref name="System Failed"/&gt;

In August 1981, at the age of 20, Dodd tried to abduct two little girls, who reported him to the police. No action was taken. The following month, he enlisted in the US Navy, and was assigned to the submarine base in [[Bangor, Washington]], where he began abusing children who lived on the base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jon|last=Rothgeb|url= https://products.kitsapsun.com/archive/1993/01-04/280202_14_local_kids_were_victims__dod.html|title=14 local kids were victims, Dodd claims|newspaper=[[Kitsap Sun]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Bremerton, Washington|date=January 4, 1993|accessdate=November 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Once, Dodd offered a group of boys $50 to accompany him to a motel room for a game of strip poker. This time, he was arrested. Despite confessing to police that he planned to molest the boys, he was released, with no charges filed.&lt;ref name="System Failed"&gt;{{cite news|first=Joan|last=Abrams|url= https://lmtribune.com/northwest/westley-alan-dodd-the-system-failed/article_b0b4d186-ace5-54a5-b2a9-d32d8dac3025.html|title=Westley Allan Dodd: The System Failed|newspaper=[[Lewiston Morning Tribune]]|publisher=T.C.I.|location=Lewiston, Idaho|date=January 12, 1992|accessdate=November 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, he was arrested again for exposing himself to a boy and discharged from the Navy. Dodd spent 19 days in jail and underwent court-ordered counseling. In May 1984, he was arrested for molesting a 10-year-old boy, but received only a suspended sentence.

Dodd planned his entire life around easy access to "targets", as he referred to children. He moved into an apartment block that housed families with children, and worked at fast food restaurants, as a charity truck driver, and other such jobs. He repeatedly molested the pre-school-aged children of a neighbor, but the woman declined to press charges, fearing the experience would be too traumatic for her children.

In 1987, Dodd tried to lure a young boy into a vacant building, but the boy refused to go with him and instead told police. Prosecutors were aware of his history of sexual offenses, and recommended five years in prison. However, once again, Dodd received minimal punishment because he had not actually touched the boy or exposed himself. He was placed on probation and ordered to seek psychiatric treatment. After finishing probation, he stopped going to treatment and moved to [[Vancouver, Washington]],&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; where he was hired as a shipping clerk.

In the early autumn of 1989, Dodd decided that David Douglas Park in Vancouver, a heavily wooded park with several secluded trails, would be a good place to find potential victims.&lt;ref name="seattletimes3"/&gt; He was arrested several times over the next few years for child molestation, each time serving short jail sentences and being given court-mandated therapy.&lt;ref name="seattletimes3"/&gt; All his victims (around 50 in all) were below the age of 12, some of them as young as 2, most of them boys.

Dodd's [[Sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]] became increasingly violent over the years saying, "The more I thought about it, the more exciting the idea of murder sounded. I planned many ways to kill a boy." A psychiatrist who evaluated Dodd following one of his convictions said that he fit the legal criteria for a "sexual [[psychopath]]".&lt;ref name="seattletimes3"/&gt;

===Murders===
On September 4, 1989, Dodd went to Vancouver's David Douglas Park, with a fish fillet knife and shoelaces, and sought out young boys to kill.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; He lured two brothers, 11- and 10-year-old Cole and William Neer, to a secluded area, where he forced them to undress, tied them to a tree and performed sex acts on them both. When he was done, he stabbed them repeatedly with a knife and fled the scene. The boys were soon discovered in the park. Cole was dead at the scene, while William died en route to the hospital.&lt;ref name="nytimes5"/&gt;

After the murders of the two brothers, Dodd started a scrapbook with newspaper clippings and other facts about the murders.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  On October 29, Dodd drove to [[Portland, Oregon]] and there he encountered four-year-old Lee Iseli and his nine-year-old brother Justin at a local park. The younger boy was playing alone on a slide, and Dodd succeeded in convincing the boy to come with him. Justin had gone home, so Dodd told Lee that he "would drive him back to his house". He managed to bring Lee to his apartment in Vancouver apparently unnoticed, and he ordered the boy to undress. Dodd then tied Lee to his bed and molested him, taking photographs of the abuse. Dodd kept Lee overnight while he continued to molest him, all the while jotting down every detail in his diary. The next morning, he strangled Lee to death with a rope and hung his body in the closet, photographing it as a macabre "trophy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Waxman|first=Olivia B.|date=January 5, 2018|title=Lessons of the Gruesome Case Behind One of America's Last Legal Executions by Hanging|url=http://time.com/5062940/westley-allan-dodd-execution-history/|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|location=New York City|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|accessdate=February 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He would later confess to police that he had not originally planned to kill the boy, but eventually decided that it was necessary to keep him from telling anyone. Dodd stuffed Lee's nude body in trash bags and threw it in some bushes near Vancouver Lake. He burned Lee's clothing in a trash barrel except for the boy's underwear, which he kept as a souvenir of the crime. One day later, Lee's body was discovered, which sparked a manhunt for the killer.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Dodd kept a low profile and mostly stayed in his apartment, writing down future plans for child abduction and also constructing a homemade torture rack for the next victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Evil 100|last=Wolcott|first=Martin Gilman|date=2004|publisher=[[Citadel Press]]|isbn=978-0806525556|location=New York City|page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
On November 13, 1989, Dodd attempted to abduct 6-year-old James Kirk II from the restroom of the [[Liberty Theatre (Camas, Washington)|New Liberty Theatre]] in [[Camas, Washington]], but the child began fighting and crying as Dodd was leaving the theater through the lobby, carrying the boy in his arms. Despite Dodd's attempts to calm the boy, theater employees became suspicious. Once outside, Dodd released his victim before getting into his car and driving away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nicholas K.|last=Geranios|url= https://products.kitsapsun.com/archive/1992/12-21/241975_citizen_who_caught_dodd_doesn__.html|newspaper=[[Kitsap Sun]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|title=Citizen who caught Dodd doesn't think himself a hero|location=Bremerton, Washington|date=December 21, 1992|accessdate=November 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boyfriend of the boy's mother, William "Ray" Graves, came to the theater lobby and was told that the boy had nearly been abducted. Graves went outside the theater in the direction where Dodd was last seen. Dodd's car had broken down a short distance away from the theater and he was attempting to start the motor. In order not to raise Dodd's suspicion and to stall for time, Graves offered to help him. He then put Dodd into a headlock and brought him back to the theater, where employees called the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nicholas K.|last=Geranios|url= https://products.kitsapsun.com/archive/1992/12-21/241975_citizen_who_caught_dodd_doesn__.html|newspaper=[[Kitsap Sun]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|title=Citizen who caught Dodd doesn't think himself a hero|location=Bremerton, Washington|date=December 21, 1992|accessdate=November 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local police contacted the Portland Police task force investigating the kidnapping and murder of Lee Iseli. Dodd was brought to the Camas Police station, where the Portland task force lead detectives [[C.W. Jensen]] and Dave Trimble interviewed him. He was then taken to the Clark County jail in Vancouver where Jensen and Trimble continued their interrogation over the course of three days. Eventually, Dodd confessed to all three murders. Jensen and Trimble then served a [[search warrant]] at Dodd's home in Vancouver.

During the search of Dodd's home, police discovered a homemade torture rack, along with newspaper clippings about his crimes, a briefcase containing Lee Iseli's underwear, a photo album containing pictures of Lee Iseli, and assorted photographs of children in newspaper and store catalog underwear advertisements. They also discovered Dodd's diary, in which he wrote in detail about the murders.

Dodd was charged with aggravated first-degree murder in the deaths of the Neer brothers and Lee Iseli, plus attempted kidnapping of another child. He initially pleaded not guilty to all charges, but later changed his plea to guilty.

==Trial==
During his trial in Clark County Superior Court, the prosecution read aloud excerpts of Dodd's diary, and displayed the photographs of Lee Iseli. The defense did not call any witnesses, or present any evidence, suggesting only that Dodd must be legally insane. Prosecutors requested the death penalty, and the jury agreed. Dodd would claim that speaking in his own defense was pointless, and ultimately, "the system had failed repeatedly". He stated that he would like to die by hanging, and that he was willing to die if "it brought peace to the victims' families".

In 1990, Dodd was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] for the murder of the Neer brothers, as well as for the separate rape and murder of Lee Iseli.

==Execution==
Less than four years elapsed between the murders and Dodd's execution. He refused to [[appeal]] his case or the capital sentence. He insisted that he was uncontrollable and would kill again, stating in one court brief: "I must be executed before I have an opportunity to escape or kill someone else. If I do escape, I promise you I will kill and rape again, and I will enjoy every minute of it."&lt;ref name="nytimes5"/&gt; He also said in some interviews that death would give him relief from guilt over the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-01-07/news/9303151248_1_westley-allan-dodd-walla-walla-state-penitentiary-pamphlet|title=Interview With A Monster|last=Kroll|first=Michael|date=January 7, 1993|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=July 21, 2018|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his trial, he wrote a pamphlet on how parents could protect children from child molesters such as himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-01-03/news/mn-1130_1_killer-writes-girl|title=Killer Writes Girl on How to Foil Molesters|date=January 3, 1993|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=February 21, 2019|publisher=[[Tronc]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|location=Los Angeles, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington state law gave Dodd the choice of either [[lethal injection]] or [[hanging]] for his execution. He chose hanging, later stating in interviews that he preferred that method "because that's the way Lee Iseli [his final victim] died".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott|last=McCabe|url= https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/crime-history-child-molester-hanged-to-death%3f_amp=true|title=Crime history: Child molester hanged to death|newspaper=[[Washington Examiner]]|publisher=MediaDC|location=Washington, DC|date=January 4, 2011|accessdate=November 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; His execution by hanging was the first in the United States since [[George York and James Latham]] were hanged by Kansas in 1965. Dodd's execution was witnessed by 12 members of local and regional media,&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press Bulletin, Jan 4 1993, 23:26&lt;/ref&gt; prison officials, and family members of the three victims. Dodd ordered broiled salmon and [[fried potatoes]] for his [[last meal]]. His last words, spoken from the second floor of the indoor gallows, were recorded by the media witnesses as:{{quote|I was once asked by somebody, I don't remember who, if there was any way [[sex offender]]s could be stopped. I said, 'No.' I was wrong. I was wrong when I said there was no hope, no peace. There is hope. There is peace. I found both in the Lord, [[Jesus Christ]]. Look to the Lord, and you will find peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://products.kitsapsun.com/archive/1993/01-05/280183_killer__39_s_final_words____39_.html|title=Killer's Final Words: 'There Is Peace'|newspaper=[[Kitsap Sun]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Bremerton, Washington|date=January 5, 1993|accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:08424-Walla Walla-1906-The State Penitentiary, Walla Walla-Brück &amp; Sohn Kunstverlag.jpg|thumb|Washington State Penitentiary at Walla Walla.]]
Dodd was executed by hanging at 12:05&amp;nbsp;a.m. on January 5, 1993 at [[Washington State Penitentiary]] in [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]]. He was pronounced dead by the prison doctor and his body transported to [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] for [[autopsy]]. The witnesses said that the King County Medical Examiner, Donald Reay, found that Dodd had died quickly, within two to three minutes, though not from a broken neck, which is the usual cause of death from hanging. Reay stated that Dodd's death had likely not been very painful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/us/coroner-concludes-murderer-felt-little-pain-when-hanged.html|title=Coroner Concludes Murderer Felt Little Pain When Hanged|agency=[[The Associated Press]]||date=January 10, 1993|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|access-date=March 10, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd was [[Cremation|cremated]] following the autopsy, and his ashes turned over to his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Driven To Kill|last=King|first=Gary|date=2011|publisher=Pinnacle Books|isbn=978-1452454504|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Execution controversy ===

Dodd's execution came with some controversy over his choice of execution by hanging. [[The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)|The American Civil Liberties Union]] filed a lawsuit saying that this method of execution was a violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|8th Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=January 15, 1993|title=Death Watch|url=|journal=[[National Catholic Reporter]]|publisher=The National Catholic Reporter Publishing Company|location=Kansas City, Missouri|volume=29|issue=11|pages=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit made it all the way to the [[Washington Supreme Court]], which ended up being unsuccessful in blocking Dodd's execution, largely because Dodd himself chose hanging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1993/01/06/a-hanging-fires-debate-over-cruelty/26e5a87a-c47c-4607-ba20-1a6ad49ad405/|title=A Hanging Fires Debate Over Cruelty|last=Duke|first=Lynne|date=January 6, 1993|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|location=Washington, DC|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the day of the execution, many people were gathered outside the prison, either supporting or protesting the execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Robert|date=February 1, 1993|title=Lynch burg|url=|journal=[[The New Republic]]|volume=208|issue=5|pages=12–13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was much media attention, some TV news reports featured stories on the history of hanging, showing such things as the loud sound that the trap door can make, along with the silence that follows it, and the type of rope that was going to be used, and how to properly prepare it for optimum effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=January 9, 1993|title=Hanging: A matter of choice|url=|journal=[[The Economist]]|volume=326|issue=7793|pages=25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Dodd's crimes are included in the [[Investigation Discovery]] series ''Real Detective''. In the episode titled "Malice" detective [[C. W. Jensen]] describes his involvement in bringing Dodd to justice and the effect it had on him personally.

Dodd was the basis for an [[unseen character]], a child killer named "Wayne Dobbs", in the 2002 film ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'', starring [[Al Pacino]]. He was fictionalized as a man who murdered a young boy in a way similar to Dodd's murder of Lee Iseli.

'''Dennis Lynn Rader''' (born March 9, 1945) is an American [[serial killer]] known as '''BTK''' or the '''BTK Strangler'''. Rader gave himself the name "BTK" (for "bind, torture, kill"). 

Between 1974 and 1991, Rader killed ten people in the [[Wichita, Kansas]] metro area.

Rader sent taunting letters to police and newspapers describing the details of his crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BbsJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA353 |title=Criminology: Theories, Patterns, and Typologies |last=Siegel |first=Larry |date=January 19, 2012 |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] | location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-133-71052-3 |page=353 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728001507/http://books.google.com/books?id=BbsJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA353 |archive-date=July 28, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBkEGAOlCDsC&amp;pg=PR17 |title=Secret History: The Story of Cryptology |last=Bauer |first=Craig P. |date=March 25, 2013 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] | location=Boca Raton, Florida| isbn=978-1-4665-6186-1 |page=17 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727084825/http://books.google.com/books?id=EBkEGAOlCDsC&amp;pg=PR17 |archive-date=July 27, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ob0KAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA254 |title=Serial Murderers and Their Victims |last=Hickey |first=Eric W. |date=2012 |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-285-40168-3 |page=254 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720155542/http://books.google.com/books?id=Ob0KAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA254 |archive-date=July 20, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a decade-long hiatus, Rader resumed sending letters in 2004, leading to his 2005 arrest and subsequent guilty plea. He is serving ten consecutive life sentences at [[El Dorado Correctional Facility]] in Kansas.

== Life and background ==
Dennis Rader was born on March 9, 1945, to Dorothea Mae Rader (née Cook) and William Elvin Rader. He is one of four sons; his brothers are named Paul, Bill, and Jeff.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsland, pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Who is Dennis Rader aka the BTK serial killer? |url=https://www-1.kansas.com/news/special-reports/btk/article225082655.html |accessdate=August 8, 2019 |work=[[Wichita Eagle]] |publisher=[[McClatchy]]|location=Wichita, Kansas

His parents both worked long hours and paid little attention to their children at home; he would later describe feeling ignored by his mother in particular, and resenting her for it.&lt;ref name=“news.au.com”&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/kansas-btk-serial-killer-dennis-rader-said-a-demon-within-me-made-him-murder/news-story/9ff3d7a3d55fa5044812f050b2332a28|title=BTK serial killer Dennis Rader said 'a demon within me' made him murder|website=[[Fox News]]|publisher=[[News Corp (2013–present)|News Corp]]|location=New York City|via=news.au.com|date=September 4, 2018|accessdate=October 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a young age, Rader harbored [[sexual sadism|sadistic sexual fantasies]] about torturing “trapped and helpless” women.&lt;ref name=“news.au.com”/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Hannah|last=Murphy|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/btk-serial-killer-what-we-learned-from-confessional-new-book-111057/amp/|title=BTK Serial Killer: What We Learned From Confessional New Book|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media LLC]]|location=New York City|date=September 12, 2016|accessdate=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also exhibited [[zoosadism]] by torturing, killing and hanging small animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lee|last=Mellor|editor1-first=Joan|editor1-last=Swart|editor2-first=Lee|editor2-last=Mellor|title=Homicide: A Forensic Psychology Textbook|chapter=Sexually Sadistic Homicide Offenders|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|location=Boca Raton, Florida|date=2016|isbn=978-1315370019|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="owlcation"&gt;{{cite web|first=Matthew I.|last=Crawford|url=https://owlcation.com/social-sciences/Profile-of-a-Serial-Killer-Part-5-Dennis-Rader-The-BTK-Killer|title=Profile of a Serial Killer: Dennis Rader, the BTK Strangler|website=Owlcation|publisher=[[Purdue University]]|location=Lafayette, Indiana|date=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acted out [[sexual fetish]]es for [[voyeurism]], [[autoerotic asphyxiation]] and [[cross-dressing]].

On January 15, 1974, four members of the Otero family were murdered in Wichita, Kansas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Tim|last=Potter|url=https://www.kansas.com/news/special-reports/btk/article1115176.html |title=Charlie Otero finds peace, stability nearly 40 years after BTK murders |work=[[Wichita Eagle]] |date=May 11, 2013|access-date=July 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701083431/https://www.kansas.com/news/special-reports/btk/article1115176.html |archive-date=July 1, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims were Joseph Otero, aged 38, Julie Otero, age 33, and two children: Joseph Otero Jr. age 9, and Josephine Otero age 11. Their bodies were discovered by the family's eldest child, Charlie Otero, who was in 10th grade at the time, as he returned home from school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After his 2005 arrest, Rader confessed to killing the Otero family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/06/27/rader.transcript/ |title=CNN.com – BTK: 'I took her to the basement and...hung her' – Jun 27, 2005 |website=[[CNN]]|access-date=July 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707195931/http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/06/27/rader.transcript/ |archive-date=July 7, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rader wrote a letter that had been stashed inside an engineering book in the [[Wichita Public Library]] in October 1974, which described in detail the killing of the Otero family in January of that year.&lt;ref name="McClellan" /&gt;

In early 1978, he sent another letter to television station [[KAKE (TV)|KAKE]] in Wichita, claiming responsibility for the murders of the Oteros, Kathryn Bright, Shirley Vian and Nancy Fox.&lt;ref name="McClellan" /&gt; He suggested many possible names for himself, including the one that stuck: BTK. He demanded media attention in this second letter, and it was finally announced that Wichita did indeed have a serial killer at large. A poem was enclosed titled "Oh!

He also intended to kill others, such as Anna Williams, who in 1979, aged 63, escaped death by returning home much later than expected. Rader explained during his confession that he became obsessed with Williams and was "absolutely livid" when she evaded him. He spent hours waiting at her home, but became impatient and left when she did not return home from visiting friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/unsolved/btk/13.html |title=The BTK Story&amp;nbsp;– More Clues Revealed |first1=Marilyn |last1=Bardsley |first2=Rachael |last2=Bell |first3=David |last3=Lohr |website=[[Crime Library]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529005912/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/unsolved/btk/13.html |archivedate=May 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine Hedge, aged 53, was found on May 5, 1985, at East 53rd Street North between North Webb Road and North Greenwich Road in Wichita. Rader had killed her on April 27, 1985, and he took her dead body to his church, the Christ Lutheran Church, where he was the president of the church council. There, he photographed her body in various bondage positions. Rader had previously stored black plastic sheets and other materials at the church in preparation for the murder and then later dumped the body in a remote ditch. He had called his plan "Project Cookie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/08/18/btk.killings.wed/ |title=BTK took body to church, says investigator |website=[[CNN]] | publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia |date=August 18, 2005 |accessdate=February 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802163531/http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/08/18/btk.killings.wed/ |archive-date=August 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, after the murders of three members of the Fager family in Wichita, a letter was received from someone claiming to be the BTK killer, in which the author of the letter denied being the perpetrator of the Fager murders. The author credited the killer with having done "admirable work." It was not proven until 2005 that this letter was, in fact, written by Rader. He is not considered by police to have committed this crime.&lt;ref name="douglas2007" /&gt; Additionally, two of the women Rader had [[stalked]] in the 1980s and one he had stalked in the mid-1990s filed [[restraining order]]s against him; one of them also moved away.&lt;ref name="a&amp;e"&gt;A&amp;E Documentary Special{{snds}}The BTK Killer Speaks&lt;/ref&gt;

His final victim, Dolores E. Davis, was found on February 1, 1991, at West 117th Street North and North Meridian Street in Park City. Rader killed her on January 19, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Geberth |first=Vernon |title=Sex-Related Homicide and Death Investigation: Practical and Clinical Perspectives |publisher=[[CRC Press]]|location=Boca Raton.

=== Cold case ===
By 2004, the investigation of the BTK Killer was considered a [[cold case]]. Then, Rader began a series of 11 communications to the local media that led directly to his arrest in February 2005. In March 2004, ''[[The Wichita Eagle]]'' received a letter from someone using the return address '''Bill Thomas Killman'''. The author of the letter claimed that he had murdered Vicki Wegerle on September 16, 1986, and enclosed photographs of the crime scene and a photocopy of her [[driver's license]], which had been stolen at the time of the crime.&lt;ref name="vic"&gt;{{cite news |title=BTK Strangler resurfaces after 25 years |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/btk-strangler-resurfaces-after-25-years-1-519136 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |work=[[The Scotsman]] | date=March 28, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714151807/http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/btk-strangler-resurfaces-after-25-years-1-519136 |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before this, it had not been definitively established that Wegerle was killed by BTK.&lt;ref name="vic" /&gt; [[DNA]] collected from under Wegerle's fingernails provided police with previously unknown evidence. They then began [[DNA profiling|DNA testing]] hundreds of men in an effort to find the serial killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/World/BTK-serial-killer-caught/2005/02/27/1109439444107.html |work=The Age |title='BTK' serial killer caught |date=February 27, 2005 |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528073227/http://www.theage.com.au/news/World/BTK-serial-killer-caught/2005/02/27/1109439444107.html |archive-date=May 28, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, over 1,300 DNA samples were taken and later destroyed by court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-05-31-DNA-BTK_x.htm |work=USA Today |title=Police destroy 1,326 DNA samples taken in BTK investigation |date=May 31, 2006 |accessdate=May 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616105137/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-05-31-DNA-BTK_x.htm |archive-date=June 16, 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2004, television station KAKE in Wichita received a letter with chapter headings for the "BTK Story," fake IDs, and a word puzzle.&lt;ref name="media.kansas.com" /&gt; On June 9, 2004, a package was found taped to a stop sign at the corner of First and Kansas in Wichita. It had graphic descriptions of the Otero murders and a sketch labeled "The Sexual Thrill Is My Bill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singular |first=Stephen |title=Unholy Messenger: The Life and Crimes of the BTK Serial Killer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOtccTWu3FYC&amp;pg=PA115 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |date=March 27, 2007 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | isbn=978-1-4165-3154-8 |pages=115–116 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724185808/http://books.google.com/books?id=BOtccTWu3FYC&amp;pg=PA115 |archive-date=July 24, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also enclosed was a chapter list for a proposed book titled ''The BTK Story'', which mimicked a story written in 1999 by [[truTV|Court TV]] crime writer [[David Lohr]]. Chapter One was titled "A Serial Killer Is Born." In July, a package was dropped into the return slot at the downtown public library containing more bizarre material, including the claim that he was responsible for the death of 19-year-old Jake Allen in [[Argonia, Kansas]], earlier that month. This claim was false, and the death was ruled a suicide.&lt;ref name="31 Years"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Potter |first1=Tim |title=After 31 years and 10 deaths pieces fall in place |url=http://www.kansas.com/news/special-reports/btk/article1003747.html |accessdate=January 21, 2015 |work=[[The Wichita Eagle]] |date=July 10, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229201313/http://www.kansas.com/news/special-reports/btk/article1003747.html |archive-date=December 29, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After his capture, Rader admitted in his interrogation that he had been planning to kill again and he had set a date, October 2004, and was stalking his intended victim.&lt;ref name="a&amp;e" /&gt; In October 2004, a manila envelope was dropped into a [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] box in Wichita. It had many cards with images of terror and bondage of children pasted on them, a poem threatening the life of lead investigator Lt. Ken Landwehr, and a false autobiography with many details about Rader's life. These details were later released to the public.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In December 2004, Wichita police received another package from the BTK killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Girard |first=James E. |title=Criminalistics: Forensic Science, Crime, and Terrorism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXJHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA417 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |date=2013 |publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers]] | isbn=978-1-4496-9180-6 |page=417 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718025951/http://books.google.com/books?id=EXJHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA417 |archive-date=July 18, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; This time, the package was found in Wichita's Murdock Park. It had the driver's license of Nancy Fox, which was noted as stolen from the crime scene, as well as a doll that was symbolically bound at the hands and feet, and had a plastic bag tied over its head.&lt;ref name="31 Years" /&gt;

In January 2005, Rader attempted to leave a cereal box in the bed of a pickup truck at a [[Home Depot]] in Wichita, but the box was discarded by the truck's owner. It was later retrieved from the trash after Rader asked what had become of it in a later message. Surveillance tape of the parking lot from that date revealed a distant figure driving a black [[Jeep Cherokee]] leaving the box in the pickup. In February, more postcards were sent to KAKE, and another cereal box left at a rural location was found to contain another bound doll, apparently meant to symbolize the murder of 11-year-old Josephine Otero.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In his letters to police, Rader asked if his writings, if put on a [[floppy disk]], could be traced or not. The police answered his question in a newspaper ad posted in the ''Wichita Eagle'' saying it would be safe to use the disk. On February 16, 2005, Rader sent a purple 1.44-Megabyte [[Memorex]] floppy disk to [[Fox Network|Fox TV]] affiliate [[KSAS-TV]] in Wichita.&lt;ref name="probe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="campnovel" /&gt; Also enclosed were a letter, a gold-colored necklace with a large medallion, and a photocopy of the cover of ''[[John Sandford (novelist)#Prey series|Rules of Prey]]'', a 1989 novel about a serial killer.&lt;ref name="campnovel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johnsandford.org/articles050303.html |title=Camp novel crops up in the BTK case |date=March 3, 2005 |publisher=johnsandford.org, attributed to "StarTribune" |accessdate=June 2, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509092637/http://www.johnsandford.org/articles050303.html |archive-date=May 9, 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Rader's August 18 sentencing, victims' families made statements, after which Rader apologized in a rambling 30-minute monologue that the prosecutor likened to an [[Academy Awards]] acceptance speech.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt; His statement has been described as an example of an often-observed phenomenon among [[psychopath]]s: their inability to understand the emotional content of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=For most people, emotional words and scenes lead to heightened activity in the [[amygdala]] as the emotional sense of the situation overcomes them, often shutting down higher functions. For psychopaths, the amygdala responds less powerfully to the same items and when it does respond it does so in step with higher cortical activity. The cortex is the brain area associated with rational thought and interpretive functions. So, psychopaths presented with an emotional stimulus have to think about its meaning and rationally make sense of it in order to parse their response. They do not feel the effects of others' fear, sadness, or pain, so they have to work to interpret their environment.&lt;br /&gt;This characteristic appears clearly in the [[allocution]] of Dennis Rader, the BTK Killer. Standing in court before the judge, the victims' families, and the assembled press, Rader listened as the judge read out the details of his offenses. Without blinking an eye, Rader stopped the judge at several junctures to correct some minor detail. Unmoved by the enormity of his crimes or the responses of the people gathered there, Rader makes almost casual responses to the facts in the case; at one point making mouth noises as he sought a precise fact. This is a man who cannot even begin to appreciate the impact he had on others.|first=Richard M.|last=Gray|date=2010|chapter=Psychopathy and the Will to Power: Ted Bundy and Dennis Rader|editor-first=Sara|editor-last=Waller|title=Serial Killers - Philosophy for Everyone: Being and Killing|location=Oxford, England|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]]|isbn=978-1444341409|pages=198–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to 10 consecutive [[life imprisonment|life sentences]], with a minimum of 175 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Sam |last=Coates |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/18/AR2005081800201.html |title=Rader Gets 175 Years For BTK Slayings |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | publisher=Nash Holdings, Inc. |location=Washington, DC |date=August 19, 2005 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024104531/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/18/AR2005081800201.html |archive-date=October 24, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kansas had no death penalty at the time of the murders.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.whotv.com/global/story.asp?s=8945 |title=BTK killer sentenced to 10 consecutive life terms |date=August 19, 2005 |publisher=WHO-TV (AP) |accessdate=August 7, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809084420/http://www.whotv.com/Global/story.asp?s=8945 |archivedate=August 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 19, he was moved to the [[El Dorado Correctional Facility]].&lt;ref name="kdoc0083707"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dc.state.ks.us/kasper/offenders?lastname=rader&amp;firstname=dennis&amp;middlename=lynn |title=Dennis Rader's listing on the Kansas Department of Corrections ''Kansas Adult Supervised Population Electronic Repository'' site |accessdate=June 2, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125191551/http://www.dc.state.ks.us/kasper/offenders?lastname=rader&amp;firstname=dennis&amp;middlename=lynn |archivedate=November 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rader talked about innocuous topics such as the weather during the 40-minute drive to El Dorado, but began to cry when the victims' families' statements from the court proceedings came on the radio. He is now in [[solitary confinement]] for his protection (with one hour of exercise per day, and showers three times per week). This will likely continue indefinitely. Beginning in 2006, he was allowed access to television and radio, to read magazines, and other privileges for good behavior.&lt;ref name="kdoc0083707" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lloyd |last=Vries |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/24/national/main1535408.shtml |title=BTK Killer Gets Extra Jail Perks |publisher=[[CBS News]] | date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=March 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025232613/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/24/national/main1535408.shtml |archive-date=October 25, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further investigations ===
Following Rader's arrest, police in Wichita, Park City and several surrounding cities looked into unsolved cases with the cooperation of the state police and the FBI. They particularly focused on cases after 1994, when the death penalty was reinstated in Kansas. Police in surrounding states such as Nebraska, Missouri, Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas also investigated cold cases that fit Rader's pattern to some extent. The [[FBI]], and local jurisdictions at Rader's former duty stations checked into unsolved cases during Rader's time in the service.

After exhaustive investigations, none of these agencies discovered any further murders attributable to Rader, confirming early suspicions that Rader would have taken credit for any additional murders that he had committed. The ten known murders are now believed to be the only murders for which Rader is actually responsible, although Wichita police are fairly certain that Rader stalked and researched a number of other potential victims. This includes one person who was saved when Rader called off his planned attack upon his arrival near the target's home due to the presence of construction and road crews nearby. Rader stated in his police interview that "there are a lot of lucky people," meaning that he had thought about and developed various levels of murder plans for other victims.&lt;ref name="InsideStory" /&gt;

=== Evaluation by Robert Mendoza ===
Massachusetts psychologist Robert Mendoza was hired by Rader's court-appointed public defenders to conduct a psychological evaluation of Rader, and determine if an insanity-based defense might be viable. He conducted an interview after Rader pleaded guilty on June 27, 2005. Mendoza diagnosed Rader with [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] and [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]]s: He observed that Rader has a grandiose sense of self, a belief that he is “special” and therefore entitled to special treatment; a pathological need for attention and admiration; a preoccupation with maintaining rigid order and structure; and a complete lack of empathy for his victims.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsland, pg. 217-18&lt;/ref&gt;

NBC claimed Rader knew the interview might be televised, but this was false according to the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office. Rader mentioned the interview during his sentencing statement. On October 25, 2005, the Kansas attorney general filed a petition to sue Mendoza and Tali Waters, co-owners of Cambridge Forensic Consultants, LLC, for breach of contract, claiming that they intended to benefit financially from the use of information obtained through involvement in Rader's defense. On May 10, 2007, Mendoza [[settlement (litigation)|settled]] the case for US$30,000 with no admission of wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BTK Psychologist to Pay State |url=http://www.wibw.com/home/headlines/7446541.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] | website=WIBW |date=May 10, 2007 |accessdate=February 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211065249/http://www.wibw.com/home/headlines/7446541.html |archive-date=February 11, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic psychologist [[Katherine Ramsland]] wrote ''Confession of a Serial Killer'' about Rader, compiled from her five-year correspondence with him. In the introduction, she describes the book as a "guided autobiography" of Rader, stating that she interjects only to "assist with chronology or provide substance, sense, or background."&lt;ref name="Ramsland"&gt;Ramsland, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The horror writer [[Stephen King]] says his novella ''[[A Good Marriage]]'', and the [[A Good Marriage (film)|film based on it]], was inspired by the BTK killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roy |last=Wenzl |title=Daughter of Wichita serial killer BTK: Stephen King 'exploiting my father's 10 victims' |url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/state/kansas/article2254570.html |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |publisher=[[McClatchy]]| location=Kansas City, Missouri |date=September 26, 2014 |accessdate=March 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317065442/http://www.kansascity.com/news/state/kansas/article2254570.html |archive-date=March 17, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novelist [[Thomas Harris]] has said that the character of [[Francis Dolarhyde]] from his 1981 novel ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'' is partially based on the then-unidentified BTK Killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beattie |first1=Robert |title=Nightmare in Wichita |date=2005 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-451-21738-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/nightmareinwichi0000beat }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 made-for-TV movie, ''[[The Hunt for the BTK Killer]]'', told the story from the perspective of the Wichita detectives who worked the case for 31 years. Rader was played by [[Gregg Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last1=Lowry |first1=Brian |title=The Hunt for the BTK Killer |url=https://variety.com/2005/scene/markets-festivals/the-hunt-for-the-btk-killer-1200521276/ |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California |date=October 6, 2005 |accessdate=December 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203013823/http://variety.com/2005/scene/markets-festivals/the-hunt-for-the-btk-killer-1200521276/ |archive-date=December 3, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Episode 15 of Season 1 (2006) of ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' is based on Rader's murders.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsland, Katherine.

Rader is a character in the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Mindhunter (TV series)|Mindhunter]]''. He appears throughout season one and season two, in vignettes set in and around [[Park City, Kansas]].

The "[[Cold Case Files]]" podcast covered the story of the murders and eventual solving of the cold case that led to Rader's arrest in their December 5, 2017 episode called "Finding BTK."

The 2018 film ''[[The Clovehitch Killer]]'' is loosely based on Rader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Gregory|last=Wakeman|url=https://www.metro.us/entertainment/movies/is-the-clovehitch-killer-based-on-real-events |title=Is 'The Clovehitch Killer' based on real events? |website=[[Metro (British newspaper)|metro.us]]|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|location=London, England|date=November 13, 2018|access-date=January 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108045809/https://www.metro.us/entertainment/movies/is-the-clovehitch-killer-based-on-real-events |archive-date=January 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2019 special "BTK: A Killer Among Us" detailed the 30-year investigation that led to the arrest of Dennis Rader. It first aired on the [[Investigation Discovery]] network on February 17, 2019.

In 2019, Rader's daughter, Kerri Rawson, released the book ''A Serial Killer's Daughter: My Story of Faith, Love, and Overcoming'', where she wrote about growing up with her father and struggling to understand his double life as a serial killer after his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rawson |first1=Kerri |title=A Serial Killer's Daughter: My Story of Faith, Love, and Overcoming |date=2019 |publisher=[[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]]|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|isbn=978-1400201761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

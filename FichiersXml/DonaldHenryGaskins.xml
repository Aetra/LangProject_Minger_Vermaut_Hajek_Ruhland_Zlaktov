'''Donald Henry''' "'''Pee Wee'''" '''Gaskins Jr.''' (né '''Parrott'''; March 13, 1933 – September 6, 1991) was an American [[serial killer]].

Gaskins was born on March 13, 1933 in [[Florence County, South Carolina]] to Eulea Parrott,&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=0fgLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=Junior+was+the+child+of+Eulea+Parrot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tbNeJSSLdX&amp;sig=wXIUj1ZuOScHj_kcYen5OaTEq5s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMI_ab0jP_cyAIV1yyICh3U1gpd#v=onepage&amp;q=Junior%20was%20the%20child%20of%20Eulea%20Parrot&amp;f=false|title=PEE WEE Serial Killer or Homicidal Maniac|last=Query|first=O.

He was small for his age and immediately gained the nickname "Pee Wee". As an adult, he was 5' 4" (157 cm) and weighed approximately 130 lbs (59 kg).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Paul|last=Rubin|url=https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/my-brother-the-killerwhats-it-like-to-have-a-mass-murderer-in-your-family-6411678|title=MY BROTHER THE KILLER: WHAT'S IT LIKE TO HAVE A MASS MURDERER IN YOUR FAMILY?|date=September 25, 1991|newspaper=[[Phoenix New Times]]|access-date=January 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.murdermiletours.com/1/post/2017/01/serial-killers-murderers-by-height.html|title=Serial Killers &amp; Murderers - By Height|website=Murder Mile Walks and True-Crime Podcast - one of the best "quirky, curious and unusual things to do in London" this weekend|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaskins' early life was characterized by a great deal of [[child neglect|neglect]]. When he was just one year old, Gaskins drank a bottle of [[kerosene]], which caused him to have convulsions until he was three years old. His mother apparently took so little interest in him that the first time he learned his given name—Donald—was when it was read out in his first court appearance, for a crime spree Gaskins committed along with a group of fellow delinquents which included [[robbery|robberies]], [[assault]]s and a [[gang rape]].&lt;ref name="Greig 2005 130"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greig|first=Charlotte|title=Evil Serial Killers: In the Minds of Monsters|date=2005|publisher=Foulsham &amp; Co Ltd.|location=New York City|isbn=0-7607-7566-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/evilserialkiller00char/page/130 130]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/evilserialkiller00char/page/130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his conviction for his role in the crime spree, Gaskins was sent to [[reform school]]. There, he was regularly [[rape]]d by his fellow inmates. After escaping from the school, getting married and voluntarily returning to complete his sentence, he was released in 1951, at the age of 18. Gaskins briefly worked on a [[Plantation economy|tobacco plantation]] until his 1953 arrest, after he attacked a teenage girl with a hammer for an alleged insult. Gaskins was sentenced to six years' imprisonment at the [[Central Correctional Institution|South Carolina Penitentiary]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Donald|last=Gaskins|first2=Wilton|last2=Earle|title=Final Truth: The Autobiography of a Serial Killer|publisher=Adept|ISBN=1-85286-494-X|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After being raped and "owned" in prison, he earned his fellow prisoners' respect by killing the most feared man in the prison, Hazel Brazell. As a result, Gaskins received an extra three years in prison, but from that point on he became the aggressor instead of the victim. He escaped from prison in 1955 by hiding in the back of a garbage truck and fled to [[Florida]], where he took employment with a [[traveling carnival]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Encyclopaedia of serial killers {{ISBN|0-7472-3731-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-arrested, remanded to custody, and paroled in August 1961.

==Early Life==
Gaskins was born on March 13, 1933 in [[Florence County, South Carolina]] to Eulea Parrott,&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; the last in a string of [[legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate children]]. He was small for his age and immediately gained the nickname "Pee Wee". As an adult, he was 5' 2" (157 cm) and weighed approximately 130 lbs (59 kg).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

When he was just one year old, Gaskins drank a bottle of [[kerosene]], which caused him to have convulsions until he was three years old.

Gaskins briefly worked on a [[Plantation economy|tobacco plantation]] until his 1953 arrest, after he attacked a teenage girl with a hammer for an alleged insult.

In Prison he earned his fellow prisoners' respect by killing the most feared man in the prison, Hazel Brazell. As a result, Gaskins received an extra three years in prison, but from that point on he became the aggressor instead of the victim. He escaped from prison in 1955 by hiding in the back of a garbage truck and fled to [[Florida]], where he took employment with a [[traveling carnival]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He was re-arrested, remanded to custody, and paroled in August 1961.

==Final arrest==
Gaskins was arrested on November 14, 1975, when a criminal associate named Walter Neeley confessed to police that he had witnessed Gaskins killing Dennis Bellamy, aged 28, and Johnny Knight, aged 15.&lt;ref&gt;Final Truth. {{ISBN|1-85286-494-X}}, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Neeley confessed to police that Gaskins had confided in him to having killed several people who had been listed as [[missing person]]s during the previous five years, and had indicated to him where they were buried. On December 4, 1975, Gaskins led police to land he owned in [[Prospect, South Carolina|Prospect]], where police discovered the bodies of eight of his victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Margaret | last=O'Shea | title=Letter denies most killings | date=1991-09-07 | url=http://thedonaldhpeeweegaskinspage.com/Newspaper3.html | work=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]] | accessdate=2008-09-27 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007065940/http://thedonaldhpeeweegaskinspage.com/Newspaper3.html | archivedate=2008-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
Gaskins was tried on eight charges of murder on May 24, 1976,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Encyclopaedia of serial killers {{ISBN|0-7472-3731-X}}, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; found guilty on May 28 and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]], which was later [[Pardon|commuted]] to [[Life imprisonment|life in prison]] when the [[South Carolina General Assembly]]'s 1974 ruling on capital punishment was changed to conform to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] guidelines for the death penalty in other states.&lt;ref name=Shuler&gt;Shuler, Rita. 2006. Carolina Crimes: Case Files of a Forensic Photographer. The History Press: Charleston, SC.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 1982, Gaskins committed another murder, for which he earned the title of the "Meanest Man in America". While incarcerated in the high security block at the [[South Carolina Penitentiary|South Carolina Correctional Institution]], Gaskins killed a [[death row]] inmate named Rudolph Tyner, who had received his sentence for killing an elderly couple during a bungled armed [[robbery]] of their store in [[Burgess, South Carolina|Burgess]]. Gaskins was [[Contract killing|hired]] to commit this murder by Tony Cimo, the son of Tyner's victims.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Final Truth. {{ISBN|1-85286-494-X}}, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaskins initially made several unsuccessful attempts to kill Tyner by lacing his food and drink with poison before he opted to use explosives to kill him. To accomplish this, Gaskins rigged a device similar to a [[Radio receiver|portable radio]] in Tyner's cell and told Tyner this would allow them to "communicate between cells".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; When Tyner followed Gaskins' instructions to hold a speaker (laden with [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4 plastic explosive]], unbeknownst to him) to his ear at an agreed time, Gaskins detonated the explosives from his cell and killed Tyner.&lt;ref name=Shuler/&gt; He later said, "The last thing he [Tyner] heard was me laughing." Gaskins was tried for the Tyner's murder and sentenced to death. It was the first time in the history of South Carolina that a white man was sentenced to death for the murder of a black man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/22/us/columbia-journal-prison-lures-them-in-as-tourists.html|title=Columbia Journal; Prison Lures Them In (as Tourists)|date=1994-02-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Final Truth"==
While on death row, Gaskins told his life story to a journalist named Wilton Earle. He claimed to having committed between 100 and 110 murders,&lt;ref&gt;[http://crime.about.com/od/serial/p/gaskins3.htm Donald "Pee Wee" Gaskins - Part 3]&lt;/ref&gt; including that of Margaret "Peg" Cuttino, the 13-year-old daughter of then South Carolina State Senator James Cuttino Jr. of Sumter.

==Execution==

Gaskins was executed on September 6, 1991, at 1:10&amp;nbsp;a.m. He was the fourth person to die in the [[electric chair]] after the death penalty was reinstated in South Carolina in 1977.&lt;ref name=Shuler/&gt; Only hours before he was escorted to the electric chair at Broad River Correctional Institution, Gaskins tried to commit suicide by slitting his wrists with a razor blade he had swallowed the previous week, then coughed up. His [[last words]] were: "I'll let my lawyers talk for me. I'm ready to go."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prolifickillers.wordpress.com/2010/06/20/profile-of-an-american-serial-killer-pee-wee-gaskins-2/|title=Profile of an American Serial Killer: Pee Wee Gaskins|date=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

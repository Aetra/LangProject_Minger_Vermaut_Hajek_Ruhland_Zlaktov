'''Rosli Dhobi''' (18 March 1932 – 2 March 1950) was a [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] [[Sarawak]]ian nationalist from [[Sibu]], [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]] during the British [[crown colony]] era in that state.

He was a member leader of the [[Rukun 13]], an active organisation in the [[Anti-cession movement of Sarawak]], along with Morshidi Sidek, Awang Rambli Bin Deli and [[Bujang Suntong]]. It was a secret cell organisation, composed of nationalists, which carried out assassinations of officers of the British Colonial government in [[Sarawak]]. He was well known for his assassination of [[Duncan Stewart (British diplomat)|Duncan George Stewart]], the second governor of [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|colonial Sarawak]], in 1949.

It has been reported that the group was in fact agitating for union with newly independent [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="BBCStabbedGov"/&gt; Previously classified documents indicate that the British Government knew this, but chose not to reveal the truth of the matter in the assassination so not to provoke Indonesia. It had recently won its [[Indonesian National Revolution|war of independence]] from the [[Netherlands]], and the UK was already dealing with the [[Malayan Emergency]] to the north-west.&lt;ref name="BBCStabbedGov"/&gt;

==Early life==
Rosli Dhobi was born on 18 March 1932 at No. 94, Kampung Pulo, [[Sibu]], [[Sarawak]] as the second child in the [[Dhobi|waserman]] family.&lt;ref name="SV"/&gt; His father, Dhobi bin Buang originated from Indonesia and was a descendant of [[Priyayi#Raden|Raden]].&lt;ref name="SV"/&gt; His mother, Habibah binti Haji Lamit came from a Sambas family and settled for a long time in [[Mukah]].&lt;ref name="SV"/&gt; Little is known about his earlier life although friends regard Rosli as an approachable person despite his quietness.&lt;ref name="SV"&gt;{{cite web|language=Malay|title=Rosli Dhoby: Merdeka dengan darah|publisher=Sarawak Voice|url=https://sarawakvoice.com/2016/09/14/rosli-dhoby-merdeka-dengan-darah/|date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an elder sister and a younger brother: Fatimah (born 1928) and Ainie (born 1933).&lt;ref name="SV"/&gt;

Rosli started his career as a teacher and quit his job in 1947 to teach in Sibu People's School. Before that, he worked at the Sarawak Public Works Department (PWD)&lt;ref name="SV"/&gt; and for Utusan Sarawak. Rosli was known to be a nationalist and a poet. Using the nickname Lidros, Rosli penned down a nationalistic poem titled 'Panggilan Mu yang Suchi' (Malay: "Your Divine Call") which was published in [[Utusan Sarawak]] on 28 February 1948. The usage of nicknames was prevalent at the time since the [[British Sarawak|British Colonial Authority]] vigorously monitored any attempts to spread words against them. He joined the Sibu Malay Youth Movement (Malay: ''Pergerakan Pemuda Melayu Sibu'') under the leadership of Sirat Haji Yaman.

Rosli joined [[Rukun 13]] in August 1948. He was introduced to the organisation by an old friend, Awang Rambli.

==Assassination of Duncan George Stewart==
[[File:Caught of Rosli Dhobi.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Rosli Dhobi caught by policemen for murdering Duncan Stewart]]

=== Background===
The end of the [[Second World War]] had brought an end to the [[Rajah of Sarawak|Brooke Dynasty]] rule in Sarawak. Believing it to be in the best interest of the people of [[Sarawak]], Rajah Vyner Brooke ceded the state to the British Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Reece 1993, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarawak became a [[Crown Colony]], ruled from the [[Colonial Office]] in London, which in turn dispatched a Governor for Sarawak.

This move was opposed by Rajah Muda [[Anthony Walter Dayrell Brooke|Anthony Brooke]], who was supposed to become the next Rajah Brooke, as well as many native Sarawakians who were initially told that they would be allowed self-government. Anthony Brooke became the leader of the anti-cession movement.

===Events===
On 4 December 1949,&lt;ref&gt;[http://indian-voice.in/tag/history/page/127/][https://www.onthisday.com/events/december/4 Duncan George Stewart was fatally stabbed by Rosli Dhobi]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duncan Stewart (British diplomat)|Duncan George Stewart]], the aforementioned appointed governor of Sarawak, was murdered by the Rukun 13 members, Rosli Dhoby, Awang Ramli Amit Mohd Deli, [[Morshidi Sidek]] and [[Bujang Suntong]] in [[Sibu]].&lt;ref name=fmt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/09/16/they-lied-rosli-dhoby-not-pro-indonesia/|author=Winston Way|title=They lied, Rosli Dhoby not pro-Indonesia|publisher=[[Free Malaysia Today]]|date=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosli Dhoby and [[Morshidi Sidek]] were among the crowd that welcomed the governor on his arrival to [[Sibu]]. After inspecting an honour guard the governor was meeting a group of local school children in near proximity of Rosli. Morshidi began to pretend to take pictures of the governor with a broken camera. The governor stopped to allow Morshidi to photograph him. At that moment, Rosli stabbed the governor.&lt;ref name=fmt/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCStabbedGov"/&gt;

Rosli was arrested on the spot and sent to [[Kuching]] for trial and later into imprisonment. Despite suffering a deep stab wound Stewart is reported to have tried to carry on until blood began to seep through his white uniform.&lt;ref name="BBCStabbedGov"/&gt; The governor was flown back to [[Kuching]] for treatment and later to Singapore, where he died a week after the incident.&lt;ref name="BBCStabbedGov"/&gt;

==Death==
After a few months languishing in prison, Rosli Dhoby, Awang Ramli Amit Mohd Deli, Morshidi Sidek and Bujang Suntong were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 4 December 1949. This move was criticised by many, as Rosli Dhobi was a juvenile at the time of assassination.

Rosli Dhoby was sent to the gallows on the morning of 2 March 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/274299|author= Bernama |title=Rosli Dhoby drama not accurate, says cousin|publisher=[[Malaysiakini]]|date=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing the resentment of the local population, the British government did not allow Rosli Dhoby's body to leave the [[Kuching Central Prison]]. Instead, his body was interred in an unmarked tomb within the prison compound.

After [[Sarawak]] gained independence on 22 July 1963 from Britain and later through the formation of the Federation of [[Malaysia]] on 16 September 1963, a tombstone was put in place at his tomb. The tombstone is now on display at the outer compound of [[Sarawak Islamic Museum]] in [[Kuching]] after the reinterment of his remains in 1996.

==Aftermath==
Sarawak was sent into tumultuous years, and the anti-Cessionists rebellion were crushed as the support by the locals dwindled due to the "aggressive" tactic used by Rosli Dhoby, alongside the oppositions from some of the Malay leaders who were pro-British. Most of the anti-Cessionists were arrested and later sent into prison, and some of them were even imprisoned in [[Changi Prison]] in Singapore.

However, things later returned to normal and peace was restored during the era of 3rd Governor of Sarawak, [[Anthony Abell|Sir Anthony Foster Abell]]. Even those who were imprisoned at Changi were allowed to return to Sarawak, to continue their sentence at Kuching Central Prison.

==Reburial==
After 46 years resting in prison compound, the remains of Rosli Dhoby were moved out of the [[Kuching Central Prison]] to be buried in the [[Sarawak's Heroes Mausoleum]] near [[Sibu Town Mosque]] at his home town of [[Sibu]] on 2 March 1996. He was given a state funeral by the Sarawak government.

==Legacy==
A school in [[Sibu]], [[Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Rosli Dhoby]] (SMKRD) was named after him.

In 2009, a miniseries spanning the period from him joining the Rukun 13 up to his death sentence was produced by Malaysian production studio KL Motion Picture Co. titled ''Warkah Terakhir'' ("The Final Letter"), with actor Beto Kusyairy portraying Rosli.

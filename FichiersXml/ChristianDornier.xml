'''Christian Dornier''' (born July 15, 1958 in Baume-les-Dames) is a [[France|French]] [[mass murder]]er who murdered his sister and mother and wounded his father with a [[Gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] [[double-barrelled shotgun]] at their farm on July 12, 1989. He then drove through the village of [[Luxiol]] and the adjacent area, shooting people at random. A total of fourteen people were killed and eight others injured in Dornier's half-hour rampage, before police managed to subdue him.

Dornier was diagnosed as suffering from [[schizophrenia]] and thus [[not guilty by reason of insanity|could not be held accountable for his crime]] according to French law, much to the anger of the victims' families.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RWMOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KIEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6637,3107279&amp;dq=dornier Farmer kills 14 nomP during shooting rampage], ''[[The Prescott Courier]]'' (July 13, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; He has been treated in a [[psychiatric hospital]] in [[Sarreguemines]] since April 1991.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Life==
Christian Dornier was the oldest child of Georges and Jeanne Dornier; he had a sister named Corinne and a brother named Serge. Dornier served twelve months in the military around 1981, which apparently negatively affected him.&lt;ref name=ERG1407&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=C-lVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oOEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5401,3138345&amp;dq= Villagers expected slayer to 'create havoc one day'], ''[[Eugene Register-Guard]]'' (July 14, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Dornier was described as a reserved person who liked to read and work in the forest. According to his brother he had no friends and hardly talked to anyone,&lt;ref name=ERG1407/&gt; sometimes not talking to anyone in the nearby village of [[Luxiol]] for weeks.&lt;ref name=OCB1307&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Fh8VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tgYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2320,8564865&amp;dq=dornier French farmer kills 14 with shotgun from car], ''[[Ocala Star-Banner]]'' (July 13, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PM&gt;Luxiol: L'itineraire de l'horreur, ''[[Paris Match]]'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

One and a half years prior to the shooting, Dornier's father decided to retire and hand over the farm to him in three years. Dornier enrolled in a month-long agricultural course to prepare for taking over the farm, but he returned after a week, apparently broken. He shaved his head, began to smoke, abandoned his farm work, and became violent. Eventually Dornier's father decided not to cede the farm to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.lesoir.be/la-guerre-avait-fait-7-morts-a-luxiol-_t-19890714-Z01UE2.html?query=%22christian+dornier%22&amp;firstHit=0&amp;by=10&amp;sort=datedesc&amp;when=-1&amp;queryor=%22christian+dornier%22&amp;pos=4&amp;all=6&amp;nav=1 La guerre avait fait 7 morts à Luxiol], ''[[Le Soir]]'' (July 14, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Three months prior to the shooting, Dornier, together with his father, bought a [[Volkswagen Golf GTI]] because he wanted the choice to leave the farm whenever he wished.&lt;ref name=PM/&gt;

In the months prior to the rampage, Dornier fired shots at his father and his neighbour René Barrand, and pelted a woman with stones. The incidents were discussed at the village council, but it was decided that no action was needed since Dornier never had any trouble with the law. However, Dornier's family was advised to get him [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] help, while his father began to hide his guns.&lt;ref name=ERG1407/&gt;&lt;ref name=Soir2207&gt;[http://archives.lesoir.be/le-tueur-fou-de-luxiol-14-morts_t-19890722-Z01V1L.html?query=%22christian+dornier%22&amp;firstHit=0&amp;by=10&amp;sort=datedesc&amp;when=-1&amp;queryor=%22christian+dornier%22&amp;pos=3&amp;all=6&amp;nav=1 Le tueur fou de Luxiol], ''[[Le Soir]]'' (July 22, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Dornier was regularly visited by a psychiatrist from [[Baume-les-Dames]], who prescribed him [[tranquilizer]]s, but according to his brother he never took them.&lt;ref name=ERG1407/&gt; Dornier's parents considered putting him in a psychiatric hospital, but he became furious when his doctor talked to him about the matter and his mother eventually decided against it.&lt;ref name=Soir2207/&gt;

In July 1989, Dornier apparently had a [[nervous breakdown]] and didn't attend the wedding of his sister on July 8. Instead, he drove through the area the entire day.&lt;ref name=PM/&gt;&lt;ref name=SdC&gt;[http://scenedecrime.blogs.com/scenedecrime/2007/06/la_tuerie_de_lu.html La tuerie de Luxiol], ''Scene de crime'' (June 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shooting==
On July 12, 1989, Dornier refused to have lunch with his family. He moved the car of his brother-in-law, Daniel Maillard, out of the way of his own vehicle, and then waited in the kitchen, where he had hidden a double-barrelled shotgun behind a cupboard. The shotgun was earlier found by Maillard when it was overthrown by his dog, though he thought that Dornier's father had put it there after the previous shooting incidents.&lt;ref name=Soir2207/&gt;

At 14:30, when the car of cattle inseminator Marcel Lechine pulled up outside the house, Dornier, apparently thinking that his brother Serge had just arrived, grabbed the gun and killed Lechine upon entry. He then opened fire at his family, killing his sister by shooting her at point-blank range,&lt;ref name=LSJ1407&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=J4QpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O2UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1380,2200520&amp;dq= Village feared French mass killer], ''[[Lewiston Sun-Journal]]'' (July 14, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; and wounding his 63-year-old father with a shot to the neck. Dornier pursued his father to a neighbour's house and shot him again in his side. He then returned home and fatally wounded his mother while she was calling police.&lt;ref name=TB1307&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VQ0VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_AIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5975,2943232&amp;dq=dornier Man kills 14 in France, including mother, sister], ''[[Toledo Blade]]'' (July 13, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; She later died in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RQ01AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oKULAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4827,3460493&amp;dq= Farmer kills 14 in French gun rampage], ''[[The Glasgow Herald]]'' (July 13, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Maillard escaped the shooting unharmed because he was in the bathroom at that time and fled through a window.

Dornier packed more ammunition and left the farm in his car, driving around the area and shooting people at random. He first encountered 10-year-old Johann Robez-Masson and his adopted brother Johnny and killed them both as they were riding their bikes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hclUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aZEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2997,1941521&amp;dq= French killer 'solitary and wild'], ''[[Tha Age]]'' (July 14, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; From a distance of 300 metres he then killed Stanislas and Marie Périard; Louis Cuenot; and Louis Liard; and wounded six others, among them Juliette Périard; Jeanine Cuenot; a 14-year-old girl named Angeline; and René Barrand, who was shot in the head and legs. Dornier also shot at the latter's wife, Marie-Therese, who was standing in her kitchen.&lt;ref name=OCB1307/&gt; After he had killed the niece of [[Mayor]] Roger Clausse, five-year-old Pauline Faivre-Pierret&lt;ref name=LSJ1407/&gt;, and was about to reload his gun to shoot her aunt when Joel Clausse, the mayor's son, grabbed a gun and fired a shot at him.&lt;ref name=LSJ1407/&gt; Dornier, hit in the neck, then fled to continue his rampage elsewhere.

While Roger Clausse alerted police, Dornier drove towards [[Baume-les-Dames]], killing Louis Girardot on the way and shooting [[gendarme]] René Sarrazin in the arm. While being chased by 40 police officers&lt;ref name=TB1307/&gt;, he shot Georges Pernin and Marie-Alice Champroy at a crossroads {{ndash}} causing their cars to crash {{ndash}} and killed Pierre Boeuf.&lt;ref name=ERG1407/&gt; When he came to [[Verne, Doubs|Verne]], he was finally engaged by police and wounded in the stomach during a shootout before being taken into custody.&lt;ref name=SdC/&gt;

The reason for the shooting is not known, though it was speculated that Dornier was angry because his father had decided not to turn over the farm's management to him.&lt;ref name=RNT1307&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZqEHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ljUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2440,2416320&amp;dq= French farmer on spree kills mother, sister, 12 others], ''[[Rome News-Tribune]]'' (July 13, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Police recovered two suitcases at Dornier's farm, packed, among other things, with books and clothes, suggesting that he had planned to flee afterwards.&lt;ref name=Soir2207/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[Prime minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Michel Rocard]] sent his condolences. All festivities planned for celebrating the [[Bastille Day]] on July 14 were cancelled in Baume-les-Dames and replaced with a solemn ceremony to commemorate the victims of the shooting.&lt;ref name=RNT1307/&gt;

Dornier was kept under heavy guard in a hospital in [[Besançon]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=P6FEAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5rUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2562,1076234&amp;dq= French murderer under heavy guard], ''[[The Junction City Daily Union]]'' (July 14, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; On July 15 he was transferred to the [[Fresnes Prison|prison hospital in Fresnes]] and charged with fourteen counts of murder and eight counts of [[attempted murder]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PvhSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8IMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4443,5614569&amp;dq= French farmer charged in 14 slayings], ''[[The Deseret News]]'' (July 15, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Two psychiatrists were appointed to examine his mental state, and in November the same year they declared that Dornier was suffering from [[schizophrenia]], was therefore [[insanity defense|not responsible for his crimes]], and should be confined in a special facility for dangerous patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.lesoir.be/le-tireur-fou-de-luxiol_t-19891107-Z023UR.html?query=%22christian+dornier%22&amp;firstHit=0&amp;by=10&amp;sort=datedesc&amp;when=-1&amp;queryor=%22christian+dornier%22&amp;pos=2&amp;all=6&amp;nav=1 Le tireur fou de Luxiol], ''[[Le Soir]]'' (November 7, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings were confirmed in February 1990&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/478343.html L'auteur de la tuerie de Luxiol est jugé irresponsable], ''[[Le Monde]]'' (February 3, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; and so he was declared insane and transferred from the prison in [[Dijon]], where he was held in [[remand (detention)|remand]], to the mental hospital in [[Sarreguemines]] on April 18, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/525192.html Auteur de la tuerie de Luxiol (Doubs) Christian Dornier est interné], ''[[Le Monde]]'' (April 21, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

An application by the victims' families to bring Dornier before a criminal court was dismissed on March 2, 1994.&lt;ref name=SdC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.lesoir.be/petits-d%C9jeuners_t-19940305-Z07X65.html?query=%22christian+dornier%22&amp;firstHit=0&amp;by=10&amp;sort=datedesc&amp;when=-1&amp;queryor=%22christian+dornier%22&amp;pos=0&amp;all=6&amp;nav=1 Petits déjeuners], ''[[Le Soir]]'' (March 5, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; On March 16 the same year, about fifty residents of Luxiol protested against the decision in front of the court in Besançon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/317745.html Tuerie de Luxiol], ''[[Le Monde]]'' (March 18, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Doodler''', also known as the '''Black Doodler''', is an unidentified [[serial killer]] believed responsible for up to 16 murders and three [[assault]]s of men in the LGBT community of [[San Francisco, California]], between January 1974 and September 1975.&lt;ref name="ency1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gijG7fSwvjAC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=%22doodler%22+san+francisco&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tn2pUd7sDc_0igLui4GQCQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22doodler%22%20san%20francisco&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes|last=Newton|first=Michael|publisher=Facts on File|year=2009|isbn=9781438119144|location=New York|page=111|pages=|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nickname was given due to the perpetrator's habit of sketching his victims prior to their sexual encounters and slayings by stabbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/news/doodler-back-in-limelight-despite-no-updates-to-case/|title='Doodler' Back in Limelight Despite No Updates to Case|last=Mojadad|first=Ida|date=2018-06-21|work=SF Weekly|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrator met his victims at gay nightclubs, bars and restaurants.&lt;ref name=ency1/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://media.ktvu.com/media.ktvu.com/photo/2018/06/21/Sf%20Chronicle%20Nov%2013%201975_1529605861531.JPG_5687939_ver1.0_640_360.jpg|title=One-Killer Theory In 6 S.F.

It is believed that the Doodler killed between five and sixteen people.&lt;ref name="bay"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dowd |first1=Katie |title=10 Bay Area cold cases that remain unsolved |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/10-Bay-Area-cold-cases-that-remain-unsolved-12872249.php |accessdate=2 December 2019 |work=SFChronicle.com |date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/news/meet-the-californian-serial-killers-who-havent-been-caught-yet/|title=Meet the Californian Serial Killers Who Haven't Been Caught...Yet - April 26, 2018 - SF Weekly|last=Mojadad|first=Ida|date=2018-04-26|work=SF Weekly|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A consistent method used in several of the killings was stabbing the victims in the front and back of their bodies in similar locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Sado Murder Horror|last=|first=|date=January 19, 1976|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the victims were white males.&lt;ref name="new" /&gt; Police theorized that the victims had all died after meeting with the suspect near the locations where their bodies were recovered.&lt;ref name=untold/&gt;

The suspect was described as a man between 19 and 25 of African descent. He was about six feet tall, with a slender build.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Miller |first1=Ryan W. |title='The Doodler' killed 5 gay men in 1970s San Francisco.

===Gerald Cavanaugh===
Gerald Earl Cavanaugh, a Canadian-American immigrant, is believed to be the Doodler's first victim.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was 49 at the time of his slaying, which had occurred by stabbing. Cavanaugh's fully clothed body was located on January 24, 1974, lying face-up on Ocean Beach in San Francisco, California, in the early hours of the morning.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/20/us/doodler-cold-case-murders/index.html|title=After more than 40 years, police say they have a suspect in cold case|last=Watt|first=Nick|date=June 21, 2018|work=CNN|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had died hours before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/sijhpdnqz94hvh4/The%20Doodler%20Investigation%20Timeline%20Presentation%20by%20Bryan%20William%20Randal.m4v?dl=0|title=2 Stabbing Deaths--One Suspect Arrested|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was determined to have been conscious at the time he was killed and had attempted to resist his killer because he had self-defense wounds.&lt;ref name="untold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theawl.com/2014/12/the-untold-story-of-the-doodler-murders|title=The Untold Story of the Doodler Murders|last1=Green|first1=Elon|date=11 December 2014|website=The Awl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111233226/https://www.theawl.com/2014/12/the-untold-story-of-the-doodler-murders/|archive-date=January 11, 2018|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially remained unidentified, being temporarily known as "John Doe #7" by the medical examiner. He was a single man and few details are available about his personal life.&lt;ref name=yesterday /&gt;

===Joseph "Jae" Stevens===
Joseph Stevens, best known by the nickname "Jae," was discovered on June 25, 1974, by a woman walking along [[Spreckels Lake]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://media.ktvu.com/media.ktvu.com/photo/2018/06/21/ViewScan_0001_1529605858816_5687937_ver1.0_640_360.jpg|title=Entertainer stabbed to death in GG Park|last=|first=|date=June 25, 1974|work=The San Francisco Examiner|access-date=September 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921011830/https://media.ktvu.com/media.ktvu.com/photo/2018/06/21/ViewScan_0001_1529605858816_5687937_ver1.0_640_360.jpg|archive-date=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevens was 27 and had died shortly before his body was found; he had been witnessed at a club the previous day. He was employed as a "female impersonator" and comedian. Officers suspected that Stevens was alive at the time he had been at Spreckels Lake, possibly transporting himself to the area with his killer.&lt;ref name=untold/&gt;

===Klaus Christmann===

Klaus Christmann, a German-American immigrant, was discovered by a woman walking her dog on July 7, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Police are asking for Help...|last=|first=|date=July 18, 1974|work=The San Francisco Sentinel|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|quote=Police are asking for help in the identification of this 25-year-old man that was found on Ocean Beach on July 7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death had been somewhat more violent than the previous murders because he had considerably more stab wounds than Stevens and had been slashed in the throat several times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The body was fully clothed.&lt;ref name=untold/&gt; Christmann, unlike the previous victims, was married and had children. The fact that he had a "make-up tube" on his person when he died suggested to police he may have been a closeted gay man.&lt;ref name=untold/&gt;

He remained unidentified briefly while police were investigating the cases, which they had believed were related after the third murder. He was buried in his native country.&lt;ref name=untold/&gt;

===Frederick Capin===
Frederick Elmer Capin, aged 32, was discovered on May 12, 1975, in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://media.ktvu.com/media.ktvu.com/photo/2018/06/21/ViewScan_0003_1529605859741_5687938_ver1.0_640_360.jpg|title=Body of stab victim found at Ocean Beach|last=|first=|date=May 12, 1975|work=The San Francisco Examiner|access-date=September 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921012421/https://media.ktvu.com/media.ktvu.com/photo/2018/06/21/ViewScan_0003_1529605859741_5687938_ver1.0_640_360.jpg|archive-date=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been stabbed like the other victims, dying from strikes to his [[aorta]]. It is believed his body had been moved approximately 20 feet as disturbances in the nearby sand indicated. Capin was identified through fingerprints when these were matched to those taken "by the state" due to his occupation as a nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Murder Unsolved|last=|first=|date=May 22, 1975|work=The San Francisco Sentinel|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had served in the United States Navy, earning medals while serving in the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name=untold/&gt;

===Harald Gullberg===

Harald Gullberg, aged 66, was a Swedish-American immigrant who was discovered on June 4, 1975 in a decomposed state about two weeks after his death in [[Lincoln Park (San Francisco)|Lincoln Park]].&lt;ref name="yesterday"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2015/10/08/yesterdays-crimes-the-serial-killer-who-stalked-gay-men-in-the-castro|title=Yesterday's Crimes: The Serial Killer Who Stalked Gay Men in the Castro|last1=Calhoun|first1=Bob|date=8 October 2015|work=SF Weekly|accessdate=25 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111233331/https://archives.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2015/10/08/yesterdays-crimes-the-serial-killer-who-stalked-gay-men-in-the-castro|archive-date=January 11, 2018|publisher=Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remains slightly inconsistent with the other homicides because he was far older than the others, his underwear had been taken by his killer and his pants were unzipped. Gullberg is believed to be the final victim of the Doodler.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While he remained unidentified, he was known as "John Doe #81."&lt;ref name=untold/&gt;

==Investigation==
[[File:Doodler Public Records Request.png|thumb|Letter from the SFPD's Legal Division detailing that the case is still active, and therefore they are unable to release any information.]]
Police questioned a young man as a murder suspect in the case, but could not proceed with criminal charges because the three surviving victims did not want to "[[outing|out]]" themselves by testifying against him in court.&lt;ref name="bay" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ency1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpM-DgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=TIME-LIFE The Most Notorious Serial Killers|last=of TIME-LIFE|first=Editors|publisher=Time Inc., Books|year=2017|isbn=1683300289|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the stabbing survivors were a "well-known entertainer" and a [[diplomat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://media.ktvu.com/media.ktvu.com/photo/2018/06/21/Sf%20Chronicle%20July%209%201977_1529605857279.JPG_5687936_ver1.0_640_360.jpg|title=The Mystery Witness in S.F.

Two other potential suspects arose in 1977 after a pair of men from Redondo Beach were arrested in Riverside County, California, and questioned on suspicion of approximately 28 murders that, like the San Francisco killings, occurred after "homosexual encounters."&lt;ref name=associatedpress1/&gt;

===Status===
As of May 2018, the case is open and ongoing in the San Francisco Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abc13.com/doodler-killer-cold-case-has-renewed-interest/3648515/|title='Doodler killer' cold case has renewed interest|date=2018-06-25|work=ABC13 Houston|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent successes using DNA technology developed in the decades since the crimes have led police to re-examine evidence in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/the-doodler-serial-killer-cold-case-unsolved-13014008.php#photo-6716706|title=Who was San Francisco's Doodler killer, and why wasn't he caught?|last=Dowd|first=Katie|date=June 21, 2018|work=SFGate|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/DNA-research-in-Golden-State-Killer-case-spurs-12889592.php|title=DNA research in Golden State Killer case spurs hope in unsolved killings|last=Fagan|first=Kevin|date=May 5, 2018|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=2018-06-13|last2=Sernoffsky|first2=Evan|quote=We’re still putting together all the various pieces in the Doodler case to see where it’s at.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2019, police offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the killer and released a revised sketch showing what he could look like four decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crime-doodler-idUSKCN1PW2XG|title=San Francisco police post reward for serial killer dubbed the...|date=2019-02-07|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-02-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later announced they would consider forensic genetic genealogy, which identified a suspect in the [[Golden State Killer]] murders.&lt;ref name="new" /&gt;

==Aftermath==

At the time, activist [[Harvey Milk]] publicly expressed empathy for the victims who refused to speak with police, stating "I understand their position. I respect the pressure society has put on them." Milk elaborated that the three men likely feared damaging relationships with family and in the workforce, citing that he believed "20% to 25%" of the 85,000 gay men in San Francisco were closeted about their sexualities.&lt;ref name=associatedpress1/&gt;

== Media ==

On February 19, 2019, it was announced on [[Deadline Hollywood]] that the San Francisco ‘Doodler’ killer would be the subject of a TV drama series written by [[Ryan J. Brown]] and produced by UK film company Ugly Duckling Films.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, Andreas (19 February 2019.  [https://deadline.com/2019/02/san-francisco-doodler-killer-crime-tv-series-ugly-duckling-films-1202559946/ "San Francisco ‘Doodler’ Killer Subject Of Crime Series From UK Outfit Ugly Duckling Films."]  ''Deadline.com''.

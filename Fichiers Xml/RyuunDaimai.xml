'''Ryuun Daimai''' (born 1872 as '''Ryumoto Daimai''' - June 26, 1916) was a [[Japan|Japanese]] [[serial killer]] and rapist, active during the [[Taishō]] era. Since many of his victims were [[bhikkhunī]], the media nicknamed him '''The Nun Slayer'''.&lt;ref name="madison"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~madison/murder/text_japan/ryuun.html|title=Daimai Ryuun|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
According to the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department]], Ryumoto Daimai was born in [[Asakusa]] in 1872, the son of a pawnbroker. When he was 7 years old, he was sent to a temple in [[Ōita Prefecture]] to be taken care of by the [[Abbot (Buddhism)|abbot]]. He trained under his former name, later receiving the name "Ryuun". In 1890, the priest passed away, and Daimai left the temple to train [[judo]] at a dojo in [[Kumamoto Prefecture]], as a [[uchi-deshi]]. During the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], which broke out in 1894, he volunteered for the military, but got his nose disfigured due to sustained injuries from a land mine.&lt;ref&gt;Goda Criminal History Society (2000) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; He later set up a temple in [[Shimada, Shizuoka|Shimada]], [[Shizuoka Prefecture]], but eventually went out and began wandering around the country.&lt;ref name="madison"/&gt;

Not long after, numerous robberies and thefts were reported, with victims describing the assailant as a monk in torn robes. Eventually, Daimai was jailed for four years in the Anon Tsu Prison, in [[Mie Prefecture]]. On January 4, 1913, he was released.&lt;ref name="madison"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~madison/murder/text_japan/ryuun.html|title=大米龍雲|access-date=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yabusaka"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yabusaka.moo.jp/ama.htm|title=連続尼僧殺し事件|access-date=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crimes ==
Daimai's crimes following his imprisonment became increasingly cruel and brutal, invading nunneries to rape and rob the nuns, and in some cases kill them, setting the structures ablaze to hide his crimes. The judiciary recorded three robbery-murders, five rapes, seven robberies and nine thefts, but the actual number of rapes and murders remains unknown. Most of the rape victims were nuns, some of them average worshippers or [[miko]], and others were affected regardless of age. It was reported that some of the victims, whom screamed too loudly, had their tongues pulled out by hand and subsequently killed.

The main offenses were as follows:

* In 1905, in [[Amagasaki]], [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], he killed a 72-year-old nun, stealing 24 [[Japanese yen|yen]].&lt;ref name="madison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yabusaka"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yabusaka.moo.jp/ama.htm|title=連続尼僧殺し事件|access-date=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 1913, Daimai raped a 60-year-old nun in [[Odawara]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], stealing a savings bankbook and 200 yen. All of the yen was later spent at a [[Red-light district|red light district]] in Fukuhara, [[Kobe]].
* In the summer of 1913, he quarreled with a 26-year-old man in Kobe, killing him near a wharf.
* Later that year, he broke into a house in [[Fukuoka]] and raped a female restaurant manager. He later made that woman his concubine.
* In the summer of 1914, he moved to Tokyo, residing in a rented room in Kyobashi. There, he robbed the Namba Temple and adjacent places.
* On September 5, 1914, in [[Kyoto]], he pulled out the tongue of a 58-year-old nun before killing her.
* On October 29, 1914, a 72-year-old nun was killed in Totsuka, Tokyo.
* On November 11, 1914, he sneaked into Nunnera Temple in [[Kamakura]], beat up the monk and fled with 20 yen and some clothing.　
* On January 27, 1915, he killed a 21-year-old nun in Kamakura.
* On July 18, 1915, a 69-year-old nun was raped and robbed in [[Asagaya]]. Testimonies from other nuns described the suspect's age, height and peculiar disfigured nose.

It is said that Daimai managed to avoid arrest, despite committing crimes from Tokyo to Keihanshin, because he used different aliases. Police suspected that a different person had raped more than 40 nuns, and mistakenly arrested him instead.&lt;ref&gt;Hidaka (2008) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrest, trial and execution ==
Daimai was arrested on August 8, 1915, at [[Hakata Station]] in Fukuoka.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=A violent struggle during escort of violent murderer|last=|first=|date=August 14, 1915|work=Asahi Shimbun (Tokyo morning edition)|access-date=|url-status=live|page=5}} - Viewed on Mizou II Visual&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, a police officer received information that the suspect intended to fly to [[Kyushu]] under the assumed name of "Utchitsuma", and despite the severe resistance, managed to arrest him.&lt;ref&gt;Goda Criminal History Research Society (2000) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 22, 1916, the [[Tokyo District Court]] sentenced Ryuun Daimai to death, with telling the judge that "[he]'ll do it for you, because it's troublesome".&lt;ref name="gouda2000"&gt;Goda Criminal History Research Society (2000) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 1916, he was executed in the Tokyo Prison (currently located in [[Shinjuku]]).&lt;ref name="madison"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“The execution of Ryuun is depressing and fast”. The Asahi Shimbun (Tokyo morning edition): p. 5 (June 27, 1916) - Viewed in the Enzo II visual&lt;/ref&gt; According to contemporary accounts from the guards, he ate buns and drank tea, chewed [[nicotiana tabacum]] and was allowed to smoke. It was said that he had a dignified attitude, saying: "Because I couldn't smoke for a long time, I went crazy." While waiting for final moments on death row, guards attempted to make a blindfold that was "antidiarrheal Yai". His last purported words were supposedly "If I could be sentenced to death, I would like to die cleanly like this. Let's get it done".&lt;ref&gt;Goda Criminal History Research Society (2000) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
